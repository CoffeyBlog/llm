After Open Enrollment ends, you can only change plans if you qualify for a Special Enrollment PeriodA time outside the yearly Open Enrollment Period when you can sign up for health insurance.

Find out if you qualify for a Special Enrollment Period
Answer a few questions to find out if you can enroll in or change a plan for 2023.
Check out if you qualify

Life changes that can qualify you for a Special Enrollment Period
Changes in household
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if in the past 60 days you or anyone in your household:
Got married. Pick a plan by the last day of the month and your coverage can start the first day of the next month.
Had a baby, adopted a child, or placed a child for foster care. Your coverage can start the day of the event — even if you enroll in the plan up to 60 days afterward.
Got divorced or legally separated and lost health insurance. Note: Divorce or legal separation without losing coverage doesn’t qualify you for a Special Enrollment Period.
Died. You’ll qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if someone on your Marketplace plan dies which causes you to lose your current health plan.
Changes in residence
You may qualify you for a Special Enrollment Period if you move to:
New home in a new ZIP code or county
The U.S. from a foreign country or United States territory
Or, move to or from:
Place you attend school (if you're a student)
Place you both live and work (if you're a seasonal worker)
Shelter or other transitional housing
Moving only for medical treatment or staying somewhere for vacation doesn’t qualify you for a Special Enrollment Period.
You must prove you had qualifying health coverage for one or more days during the 60 days before your move. You don't need to provide proof if you’re moving from a foreign country or United States territory.
Loss of health insurance
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you or anyone in your household lost qualifying health coverage in the past 60 days OR expects to lose coverage in the next 60 days.
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you lost:
Job-based coverageOpen
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you lose health coverage through your employer or the employer of a family member, including if you lose health coverage through a parent or guardian because you're no longer a dependent.
Notice: 
Voluntarily dropping coverage you have as a dependent doesn't qualify you for a Special Enrollment Period unless you also had a decrease in household income or a change in your previous coverage that made you eligible for savings on a Marketplace plan.

Individual health coverageOpen
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you lose individual health coverage, including if:
Your individual plan or your Marketplace plan is discontinued (no longer exists).
You lose eligibility for a student health plan.
You lose eligibility for a plan because you no longer live in the plan’s service area.
Your individual or group health plan coverage year is ending in the middle of the calendar year and you choose not to renew it.
Your household income decreased, and now you qualify for savings on a Marketplace plan.
Notice: 
You won’t qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you lost coverage because you didn’t provide required documentation. Get details about sending documents.

Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage (or were denied Medicaid/CHIP)Open
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you lost Medicaid or CHIP since March 31, 2023.
You may also qualify if you lose or were denied Medicaid or CHIP coverage because:
You're no longer eligible. Like if you had a change in household income that makes you ineligible for Medicaid.
Your child ages off CHIP.
You applied for Medicaid/CHIP or Marketplace coverage during Open Enrollment or with a different Special Enrollment period and were told you might be eligible for Medicaid/CHIP. But, when your state agency told you that you weren’t eligible, Open Enrollment or your Special Enrollment Period had already ended.
Eligibility for MedicareOpen
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you lose premium-free Medicare Part A.
You don’t qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you lose:
Medicare Part A because you didn’t pay your Medicare premium.
Medicare Parts B or D only.
Coverage through a family memberOpen
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you lose qualifying health coverage you had through a parent, spouse, or other family member. This might happen if you lose health coverage because:
You turn 26 (or the maximum dependent age allowed in your state) and can no longer be on a parent’s plan.
A family member loses health coverage or coverage for their dependents.
A divorce or legal separation.
The death of a family member.
You’re no longer a dependent.
You won’t qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you chose to drop the coverage you have as a dependent, unless you also had a decrease in household income or a change in your previous coverage that made you eligible for savings on a Marketplace plan.
 
An employer offer to help with the cost of coverage
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you (or anyone in your household) were offered an individual coverage HRA or a Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement (QSEHRA) in the past 60 days OR expects to in the next 60 days.
Note: Your employer may refer to an individual coverage HRA by a different name, like the acronym “ICHRA.”
If you qualify to enroll in Marketplace coverage through this Special Enrollment Period, contact the Marketplace Call Center to complete your enrollment. You can’t do this online.
More qualifying changes
Other situations that may qualify you for a Special Enrollment Period:
Gaining membership in a federally recognized tribe or status as an Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) Corporation shareholder
Becoming a U.S. citizen
Leaving incarceration
Starting or ending service as an AmeriCorps State and National, VISTA, or NCCC member
Learn about Special Enrollment Periods for complex issues.
Notice: 
You may have to verify your information

If you pick a health plan without dental benefits, you can still get a separate dental plan.
Notice: 
IMPORTANT: You can’t buy a Marketplace dental plan unless you’re buying a health plan at the same time.

Dental coverage is available 2 ways

Health plans with dental coverage: Some Marketplace health plans have dental coverage. You can see which plans include dental coverage when you compare them.
	If a health plan includes dental, the premium covers both health and dental coverage.


Separate dental plans: In some cases, separate dental plans are offered. You can see them when you shop for plans in the Marketplace.
	If you pick a separate dental plan, you’ll pay a separate premium. This is in addition to the premium you pay for your Marketplace health plan.

Dental plan categories: High and low
There are 2 categories of Marketplace dental plans: High and low.
High coverage level has higher premiumsThe amount you pay for your health insurance every month. In addition to your premium, you usually have to pay other costs for your health care, including a deductible, copayments, and coinsurance. If you have a Marketplace health plan, you may be able to lower your costs with a premium tax credit.Refer to glossary for more details. but lower copaymentsA fixed amount ($20, for example) you pay for a covered health care service after you've paid your deductible.Refer to glossary for more details. and deductiblesThe amount you pay for covered health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. With a $2,000 deductible, for example, you pay the first $2,000 of covered services yourself.Refer to glossary for more details.. So you'll pay more every month, but less when you get dental services.
Low coverage level has lower premiums but higher copayments and deductibles. So you’ll pay less every month, but more when you get dental services.
When you compare dental plans in the Marketplace, you’ll find details about each plan’s costs, copayments, deductibles, and services covered.
Adult & child dental insurance in the Marketplace
Dental insurance is treated differently for adults and children 18 and under.

Dental coverage is an essential health benefit for children. This means if you’re getting health coverage for someone 18 or younger, dental coverage must be available for your child either as part of a health plan or as a separate dental plan.
Note: While dental coverage for children must be available to you, you don’t have to buy it.


Dental coverage isn't an essential health benefit for adults. Health plans don’t have to offer adult dental coverage.

Some states expanded their Medicaid programs to cover all people below certain income levels.
Notice: 
Check if you qualify based on income
Enter your household size and state, and we'll tell you if you may qualify for Medicaid or savings on a Marketplace plan.
Find out now

Even if you don't qualify for Medicaid based on income, you should apply. You may qualify for your state's program, especially if you have children, are pregnant, or have a disability. You can apply for Medicaid and CHIP any time of year.

Apply for Medicaid and CHIP 2 ways
1. Fill out an application through the Marketplace
If it looks like anyone in your household qualifies for Medicaid or CHIP, we’ll send your information to your state agency. They’ll contact you about enrollment.
When you submit your Marketplace application, you’ll also find out if you qualify for cost savings on a Marketplace plan. Plans may be more affordable than you think.
Create an account to start a Marketplace application.
2. Or, apply directly through your state Medicaid agency
Select your state below to get your Medicaid agency’s contact information.

Medicaid & CHIP basics
Medicaid basicsOpen
In all states, Medicaid provides coverage for some low-income people, families and children, pregnant people, the elderly, and people with disabilities.
Some states expanded their Medicaid program to cover all adults below a certain income level. Learn more about Medicaid expansion and what it means for you.
Medicaid programs must follow federal guidelines, but coverage and costs may be different from state to state.
Some Medicaid programs pay for your care directly. Others use private insurance companies to provide Medicaid coverage.
Medicaid may be able to help you pay for medical care from the last 3 months, even if you weren’t enrolled in Medicaid at the time you got medical care. Payment depends on your family’s income at the time.
Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) basicsOpen
In all states, CHIP provides low-cost health coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid. In some states, CHIP covers pregnant people.
Each state works closely with its state Medicaid program.
In many cases, if you qualify for savings on a Marketplace plan, your children will qualify for either Medicaid or CHIP.
Learn more about CHIP.
More answers: Medicaid & CHIP
What services does Medicaid cover?Open
Medicaid benefits are different in each state. But all states provide comprehensive coverage. Get a list of services Medicaid offers in all states.
What’s the income level to qualify for Medicaid?Open
It depends on the state you live in.
If your state has expanded Medicaid: Check if your income qualifies.
If your state has not expanded Medicaid: You may qualify based on your state’s existing rules. Rules vary from state to state and may take into account income, household size, family status (like pregnancy or caring for young children), disability, age, and other factors. Because each state and each family situation is different, there’s no way to find out if you qualify without filling out an application.
If my income’s too high for Medicaid, can I buy insurance through the Marketplace?Open
Generally yes, as long as you qualify to use the Marketplace. Most people whose incomes are just above the level to qualify for Medicaid can pay very low premiums and out-of-pocket costs for private health insurance through the Marketplace. Check if you’ll qualify for savings.
What if I'm eligible for Medicaid, but want to get Marketplace coverage instead?Open
A Marketplace health plan would cost more than Medicaid and usually wouldn’t offer more coverage or benefits. If you qualify for Medicaid, you aren’t eligible for savings on a Marketplace plan. You’d have to pay full price for a plan.
What if I have Medicaid now, but I have only limited benefits?Open
Some limited types of Medicaid coverage pay only for:
Family planning
Treatment of an emergency medical condition
Tuberculosis services
If you have limited Medicaid coverage, you can fill out an application through the Marketplace and find out if you qualify for full-benefit coverage through either Medicaid or a Marketplace insurance plan with savings based on your income.
Notice: 
If you have limited Medicaid coverage, don’t check the box saying you have Medicaid when you're asked if you have coverage now in the Marketplace application. Instead, check “None of the above.”

What rules apply to former foster children and Medicaid?Open
All states must offer former foster children uninterrupted Medicaid coverage until they turn 26, as long as at least one of the following is true:
They were in the foster care system and received Medicaid benefits on their 18th birthday
They aged out of the foster care system with Medicaid coverage after they were 18 or older
For former foster children who turned 18 on or after January 1, 2023, states must offer the same Medicaid coverage to individuals regardless of the state in which they aged out of foster care. Some states also cover former foster children who turned 18 before January 1, 2023, from other states. Check with your state Medicaid agency to learn more.
What if I’ve been turned down for Medicaid or CHIP coverage?Open
You may be able to get Marketplace coverage instead. You may qualify for a premium tax credit or other cost savings for a Marketplace plan. Four in five customers are able to find health coverage for $10 or less a month.
If your state Medicaid or CHIP agency said you’re not eligible
If your state agency said someone in your household isn’t eligible, you’ll get a notice explaining this.
In most cases, the state will securely send your information to the Marketplace. We'll send you a letter about applying for Marketplace coverage. You can apply for Marketplace coverage by logging into your Marketplace account. Your application will be pre-filled with information you gave the state agency.
If your state hasn't expanded Medicaid coverage
If your state hasn’t expanded Medicaid and your state agency said you’re not eligible under its current rules, you may have fewer options for coverage. Depending on your income you may not qualify for savings on a private insurance plan.
Learn about your options if you’re in this situation.

How to Choose a Plan in
the Health Insurance
Marketplace®

Choosing a health insurance plan can be complicated. Knowing just a few things before you compare plans can make it simpler.

The 4 “metal” categories: There are 4 categories of health insurance plans: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. These categories show how you and your plan share costs. Plan categories have nothing to do with quality of care.


Your total costs for health care: You pay a monthly bill to your insurance company (a "premium"), even if you don’t use medical services that month. You pay out-of-pocket costs, including a deductibleThe amount you pay for covered health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. With a $2,000 deductible, for example, you pay the first $2,000 of covered services yourself.Refer to glossary for more details., when you get care. It’s important to think about both kinds of costs when shopping for a plan.


Plan and network types — HMOA type of health insurance plan that usually limits coverage to care from doctors who work for or contract with the HMO. It generally won't cover out-of-network care except in an emergency. An HMO may require you to live or work in its service area to be eligible for coverage. HMOs often provide integrated care and focus on prevention and wellness.Refer to glossary for more details., PPOA type of health plan that contracts with medical providers, such as hospitals and doctors, to create a network of participating providers. You pay less if you use providers that belong to the plan’s network. You can use doctors, hospitals, and providers outside of the network for an additional cost.Refer to glossary for more details., POSA type of plan in which you pay less if you use doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers that belong to the plan’s network. POS plans also require you to get a referral from your primary care doctor in order to see a specialist.Refer to glossary for more details., and EPOA managed care plan where services are covered only if you go to doctors, specialists, or hospitals in the plan’s network (except in an emergency).Refer to glossary for more details.: Some plan types allow you to use almost any doctor or health care facility. Others limit your choices or charge you more if you use providers outside their network.



Remember that plans also may differ in quality. Learn more about quality ratings.

Why it’s important to update your application immediately

If your income estimate goes up or you lose a household member:

You may qualify for less savings than you’re getting now. If you don’t report the change, you could have to pay money back when you file your federal tax return.


If your income estimate goes down or you gain a household member:

You could qualify for more savings than you’re getting now. This could lower what you pay in monthly premiums.
You could qualify for free or low-cost coverage through Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

The amount of your premium tax credit depends on the estimated household income for 2023 that you put on your Marketplace application.
Find out if your estimated 2023 income is in the range to qualify for a premium tax credit.
You can apply some or all of this tax credit to your monthly insurance premium payment. The Marketplace will send your tax credit directly to your insurance company, so you’ll pay less each month. This is called taking an "advance payment of the premium tax credit."
When your income changes, so does your premium tax credit
If your income changes, or if you add or lose members of your household, your premium tax credit will probably change too.
It’s very important to report income and household changes to the Marketplace as soon as possible.
If your income goes up or you lose a member of your household: You’ll probably qualify for a lower premium tax credit. You may want to reduce the amount of tax credit you take in advance each month. This way you don’t wind up taking more credits than you qualify for.
If your income goes down or you gain a household member: You’ll probably qualify for a bigger premium tax credit. You may want to increase the amount of tax credit you take in advance so you have a lower premium bill each month.
Note: If your income is within a certain range, you may be able to enroll in or change Marketplace coverage through a new Special Enrollment PeriodA time outside the yearly Open Enrollment Period when you can sign up for health insurance. You qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you’ve had certain life events, including losing health coverage, moving, getting married, having a baby, or adopting a child, or if your household income is below a certain amount.Refer to glossary for more details. based on estimated household income. Learn more.
Notice: 
IMPORTANT
If at the end of the year you’ve taken more advance payments of the premium tax credit than you’re eligible for, you may have to pay money back when you file your federal income tax return. This is called “reconciling” the advance payments of the premium tax credit and the actual premium tax credit you qualify for based on your final 2023 income.

You’ll also find out if your income qualifies you for extra savings known as “cost-sharing reductionsA discount that lowers the amount you have to pay for deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. In the Health Insurance Marketplace®, cost-sharing reductions are often called “extra savings.” If you qualify, you must enroll in a plan in the Silver category to get the extra savings.Refer to glossary for more details.. ” If it does, you can save money a second way: by paying less out of pocket each time you get medical services.
Notice: 
Getting extra savings with a Silver plan
If you qualify for cost-sharing reductions: You must pick a plan in the Silver categoryOne of 4 categories of Health Insurance Marketplace® plans (sometimes called “metal levels”). Silver plans fall about in the middle: You pay moderate monthly premiums and moderate costs when you need care. Important: If you qualify for “cost sharing reductions” (or “extra savings”) you can save a lot of money on deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance when you get care — but only if you pick a Silver plan.Refer to glossary for more details. to get these extra savings on out-of-pocket costs.
If you enroll in a plan in another health plan category, you can still use a premium tax credit. But, you won’t get these extra savings.
Silver plans may also be available if you’re eligible for a premium tax credit and can enroll through a Special Enrollment Period based on estimated household income.

If you’re enrolled in a Silver plan and lose your cost-sharing reductions: You’ll qualify for a Special Enrollment Period. If you want to change plans, you can enroll in a Bronze, Silver or Gold plan that meets your needs and fits your budget.

Do you qualify for cost-sharing reductions?
Use this quick tool to see if your 2023 income estimate falls in the range for cost-sharing reductions.
If it does fall in the range, the amount you'll save on out-of-pocket costs depends on your specific income estimate. The lower your income within the range, the more you'll save.
You'll find out exactly how much you'll save only after you apply and shop for Silver plans in the Marketplace.
How cost-sharing reductions work
If you qualify for savings on out-of-pocket costs and enroll in a Silver plan:
You'll have a lower deductible. This means the insurance plan starts to pay its share of your medical costs sooner. For example, if a particular Silver plan has a $750 deductible, you have to pay the first $750 of medical care yourself before the insurance company pays anything (other than for free preventive services). But if you qualify for cost-sharing reductions, your deductible for a Silver plan could be $300 or $500, depending on your income.
You'll have lower copayments or coinsurance. These are the payments you make each time you get care — like $30 for a doctor visit. If a Silver plan's copayment is $30 for a doctor's visit, if you enroll in the plan and qualify for extra savings, you may pay $20 or $15 instead.
You'll have a lower "out-of-pocket maximum." This means the total amount you'd have to pay in a year if you used a lot of care, like if you got seriously sick or had an accident, would be lower. Instead of $5,000, your out-of-pocket maximum for a particular Silver plan could be $3,000.
Note: These examples explain how cost-sharing reductions work. Your costs will vary depending on which plan you pick.
Plans in all categories have a wide range of deductibles, copayments/coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximums. You'll know exactly how much you save on out-of-pocket costs only when you shop for Silver plans in the Marketplace.
American Indians and Alaska Natives and cost-sharing reductions
Learn about special cost-sharing reduction rules for American Indians and Alaska Natives.
How will I find out if I qualify for cost-sharing reductions?Open
After you apply for Marketplace coverage, check your Eligibility Determination Notice. If it says "Can choose a health plan with lower copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles" and is followed by (04), (05), or (06), you qualify for income-based savings — but only if you pick a Silver plan.
If I choose a Catastrophic plan will I qualify for savings on out-of-pocket costs?Open
No. Cost-sharing reductions apply only to Silver plans. (Catastrophic plans are also not eligible for a premium tax credit, no matter what your income is.)

The monthly premium is usually lower, but you pay more health care costs yourself before the insurance company starts to pay its share (your deductible). A high deductible plan (HDHP) can be combined with a health savings account (HSA), allowing you to pay for certain medical expenses with money free from federal taxes.Refer to glossary for more details. in combination with opening a Health Savings Account (HSA)A type of savings account that lets you set aside money on a pre-tax basis to pay for qualified medical expenses. By using untaxed dollars in a Health Savings Account (HSA) to pay for deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and some other expenses, you may be able to lower your overall health care costs. HSA funds generally may not be used to pay premiums.Refer to glossary for more details..
How High Deductible Health Plans and Health Savings Accounts can reduce your costs
If you enroll in an HDHP, you may pay a lower monthly premium but have a higher deductibleThe amount you pay for covered health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. With a $2,000 deductible, for example, you pay the first $2,000 of covered services yourself.Refer to glossary for more details. (meaning you pay for more of your health care items and services before the insurance plan pays).
If you combine your HDHP with an HSA, you can pay that deductible, plus other qualified medical expenses, using money you set aside in your tax-free HSA.
So if you have an HDHP and don’t need many health care items and services, you may benefit from a lower monthly premium. If you need more care, you’ll save by using the tax-free money in your HSA to pay for it.
Your HSA balance rolls over year to year, so you can build up reserves to pay for health care items and services you need later.
What’s considered a High Deductible Health Plan?
Under the tax law, HDHPs must set a minimum deductible and a limit, or maximum, on out-of-pocket costs.
For calendar year 2023, these amounts for HDHPs are:
  Minimum deductible (The amount you pay for health care items and services before your plan starts to pay)Maximum out-of-pocket costs (The most you’d have to pay if you need more health care items and services)
Individual HDHP

$1,500

$7,500

Family HDHP

$3,000

$15,000
HDHP deductibles are often significantly higher than the minimums shown above and can be as high as the maximum out-of-pocket costs shown above.

Two important things to know:
Marketplace savings are based on your expected household income for the year you want coverage, not last year’s income.
Income is counted for you, your spouse, and everyone you'll claim as a tax dependent on your federal tax return (if the dependents are required to fileThe minimum income requiring a dependent to file a federal tax return. 2022 filing requirements for dependents under 65: Earned income of at least $12,950, or unearned income (like from investments or trusts) of at least $1,150. You must include on your Marketplace application income for any dependent required to file.Refer to glossary for more details.). Include their income even if they don’t need health coverage. See details on who to include in your household.
How to make an estimate of your expected income
Step 1. Start with your household’s adjusted gross income (AGI)Your total (or “gross”) income for the tax year, minus certain adjustments you’re allowed to take. Adjustments include deductions for conventional IRA contributions, student loan interest, and more. Adjusted gross income appears on IRS Form 1040, line 11.Refer to glossary for more details. from your most recent federal income tax return.
Don’t have recent AGI? See another way to estimate your income.
Step 2. Add the following kinds of income, if you have any, to your AGI:
Tax-exempt foreign income
Tax-exempt Social Security benefits (including tier 1 railroad retirement benefits)
Tax-exempt interest
Don’t include Supplemental Security Income (SSI).
Step 3. Adjust your estimate for any changes you expect.
Consider things like these for all members of your household:
Expected raises
New jobs or other employment changes, including changes to work schedule or self-employment income
Changes to income from other sources, like Social Security or investments
Changes in your household, like gaining or losing dependents. Gaining or losing a dependent can have a big impact on your savings.
Now you have an estimate of your expected income.

What income to include in your estimate
Estimating unpredictable income
It’s hard to predict your income if you’re unemployed, self-employed, on commission, or on a work schedule that changes regularly.
If your income is hard to predict, base your estimate on your past experience, recent trends, what you know about possible changes at your workplace, and similar information. If the job is new to you, ask people in the same field or in the same company about their experiences.

IMPORTANT Update your Marketplace application as soon as possible when your income or household members change during the year. Learn how to update your information during the year.


More answers: Income & household size
How do I upload documents to verify my income for the Marketplace?Open
If the Marketplace tells you to provide pay stubs, self-employment records, or other information to verify your income, follow these directions to upload documents.
What is "MAGI," and do I need to use it for anything?Open
The Heath Insurance Marketplace uses an income figure called Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)The figure used to determine eligibility for premium tax credits and other savings for Marketplace health insurance plans and for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). MAGI is adjusted gross income (AGI) plus these, if any: untaxed foreign income, non-taxable Social Security benefits, and tax-exempt interest.Refer to glossary for more details. to determine the programs and savings you qualify for. For most people, it’s identical or very close to Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). MAGI is not a line on your federal tax return.
The estimate instructions above are based on MAGI, but it’s not a term you need to know in order to apply or use tools on this site.
What if I don’t know my household’s recent Adjusted Gross Income?Open
Start with “federal taxable wages” for each income earner in your household.
You should find this amount on your pay stub.
If it's not on your pay stub, use gross income before taxes. Then subtract any money the employer takes out for health coverage, child care, or retirement savings.
Multiply federal taxable wages by the number of paychecks you expect in the tax year to estimate your income.
See what other household income sources to include.
Adjust all income amounts for expected changes during the year.
Why do I need to include people in my household who don’t need insurance?Open
Marketplace savings are based on income for all household members, not just the ones who need insurance.
If anyone in your household has coverage through a job-based plan, a plan they bought themselves, a public program like Medicaid, CHIP, or Medicare, or another source, include them and their income on your application.
When you apply you’ll say which household members need coverage.
What if my household income changes during the year?Open
Report income and household changes on your Marketplace insurance application as soon as possible. If you don’t, you could wind up with the wrong amount of savings or even the wrong insurance plan. Learn how to update your income during the year.
Are income and household rules the same for Marketplace insurance plans and Medicaid coverage?Open
There are some differences, depending on your state and other factors. The Marketplace application may ask you specific questions to see if you’re eligible for Medicaid. If it looks like anyone in your household qualifies for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), we’ll send your application to your state agency. They may ask you for more information. If it turns out you’re eligible, they’ll help you enroll.

Protect your account even more by getting a unique security code each time you log in. This makes it harder for someone to get into your account, if they get your password.
If you forgot them or can’t log in, follow these steps.
Warning: 
IMPORTANT: Don’t create a second account.
Don’t try to create another account if you already have one. Follow the steps below.

If you forgot your password or username
Forgot your password

Select the “Forgot your password?” link on the log in page and follow the directions.
Can’t remember the email address you used to set up your account? Check if you kept a record of that email address. If you can’t access the email account, contact the Marketplace Call Center.
Correct password not working? We occasionally need to reset passwords to protect your personal information. If you’re sure you entered it correctly but it’s not working, select the “Forgot your password?” link on the log in page and follow the directions.

Forgot your username

If you created your account after February 2014, your username is probably your email address. If you created it before then, it’s probably not.
Here are the requirements for usernames:

It must be between 5-74 characters
It can include letters and numbers
It can contain one of these symbols, as long as it’s not the last character in the username: _ . @ / -


If you still can’t remember, select the "Forgot your username?" link on the log in page and follow the directions.

If you forgot the answers to your security questions

When you created your account, you selected security questions that only you know the answers to. If you forget your password or username, we’ll ask you these questions.
If you can’t remember the answers, contact the Marketplace Call Center to unlock your account. After we verify who you are, we’ll send a password reset email within 24 hours.

If you didn’t get a security code

If you set up more than one way to get security codes, you can pick another way to get your code and log in.
If you get security codes by text:

Check your spam or unknown sender folder. The security code may go to a spam folder depending on the settings you chose on your mobile phone for blocking or filtering unknown senders.
Add "1-888-486-3063" to your phone contacts. Then, you can request to get a new code.
If you replied "STOP" to opt-out of getting text messages with your security code, text "START" to 1-888-486-3063, and then log in. You can then select "Security code settings" to remove your mobile phone number, so you no longer get text messages for your security codes.


If you get security codes by email, check your spam for junk folder. Look for an email from account@healthcare.gov. It may take a few minutes to get the email message. You can also request to get a new code. After a few minutes, if you still don’t get an email with your security code, contact the Marketplace Call Center.
Did you change your phone number, mobile phone provider, or email? Contact the Marketplace Call Center for help logging in. Once you log into your account, select "Security code settings" to change or remove any old emails or phone numbers.

If your security code doesn’t work

Remember, security codes expire. They only work for 5 minutes.
You can request to get a new code. If your new code doesn’t work, contact the Marketplace Call Center.

If you still can't access your account

Contact the Marketplace Call Center.
Make sure you have your username. We may ask for your full name, date of birth, and two more pieces of information — like your Social Security Number, application ID number, full address, or phone number — to verify who you are.

You must send these documents before you can start using your coverage.
You’ll find out if you have to provide documents after you submit your application. Details and instructions will be on your Marketplace Eligibility Notice.
It’s best to pick a plan first and submit your documents afterwards. After you pick a plan, you have 30 days to send the documents.
Your coverage start date is based on when you pick a plan. But you can’t use your coverage until we confirm your eligibility and you make your first premium payment.
If your eligibility notice doesn't say you need to submit documents, you don’t have to. Simply pick a plan and enroll.

Already lost coverageOpen
If you already lost coverage you must:
Pick a plan within 60 days after date coverage ended.
Submit documents within 30 days of picking a plan.

How to submit documents
Send the required documents as soon as possible after you pick a plan to prevent a delay in your coverage starting. Get a full list of acceptable documents to confirm loss of coverage.
You can submit documents two ways:
Upload
This is the fastest way to submit your documents.
You’ll need to have scanned copies or clear photos of the documents.
Documents must meet these requirements:Accepted formats: .pdf, .jpeg, .jpg, .gif, .xml, .png, .tiff, .bmp
Maximum file size: 10MB
File names can’t include special characters like / \ : * ? “ |

Once you have the documents on your computer, log into HealthCare.gov to upload them. Follow these step-by-step instructions (PDF, 582 KB) or log in now.
Mail
Don't send original documents – send photocopies only.
Mail documents to:
	Health Insurance Marketplace
	Attn: Supporting Documentation
	465 Industrial Blvd.
	London, KY 40750-0001
After you submit your documents
You should get a letter in your HealthCare.gov account within a couple of weeks telling you if we confirmed your Special Enrollment Period.
If your Special Enrollment Period is confirmed:
We’ll tell the insurance plan you picked.
You’ll need to pay your first premium directly to the insurance company — not to the Health Insurance Marketplace®. Your coverage won’t start until you pay your first premium.

Notice: 
If confirmation delays kept you from using your plan after the coverage start date, you may have to pay premiums for one or more previous months. When you do, medical expenses you had after the start date may be covered. This is called "retroactive" coverage.

If your Special Enrollment Period can’t be confirmed:
You’ll get a letter in your Marketplace account explaining why.
You can upload different documents to confirm.

Notice: 
If you don’t have any of the acceptable documents, you can send a letter explaining why. Learn more about what to include in the statement.

More answers
What if I don’t pick a plan within 60 days of moving or losing coverage?Open

First, do whatever you can to get them. Sending the right documents is the best way to start using your coverage as soon as possible.

Save the file to your computer, fill out the section related to your life event, and upload it online or mail it in. If you need more room, continue on a blank sheet of paper.
The Marketplace will take your letter of explanation into consideration and let you know if it’s acceptable confirmation.
Can I submit my documents before I pick a plan?Open
Yes, but you must pick a plan within 60 days of the event that qualifies you for the Special Enrollment Period.

Warning: Important: You must pay your premium for your coverage to start
Once you enroll in a plan, you'll pay your premiums directly to the insurance company — not to the Health Insurance Marketplace®. Your coverage won't start until you pay your first premium. Make sure you continue to pay your monthly premiums to your health insurance company on time. If you don't, the insurance company could end your coverage.


How to pay your monthly premium at HealthCare.gov
Log in to your Marketplace account.
Choose your application under "Your Existing Applications."
Click the blue button "Pay Your First Health Insurance Monthly Premium."
If online payment is available, choose the green button "Pay for Health Plan Now" to go to your insurance company’s website to pay. 
Note: If your health insurance company doesn't accept online payment, they should have contacted you with next steps. Reach out to them if you haven’t received details on how to pay or aren’t sure that you paid. For their phone number, check out your plan brochure or go to their website.
How to tell if your health insurance is active
If you're not sure you're enrolled, check your online Marketplace account. If you think you're enrolled but have questions about your plan, you can reference your plan materials.
How to verify your enrollment online
Log in to your HealthCare.gov account.
Select your completed application under "Your Existing Applications."
Click on "My Plans & Programs" to see which plan(s) you're enrolled in. Here you'll see a summary of your coverage. Your coverage start date depends on when you enrolled or changed plans.
If you don't see your summary or still aren't sure you finished enrollment, call your insurance company. They can confirm if you enrolled and paid your first premium.
If you're still having issues, contact the Marketplace Call Center.
How to access your plan enrollment materials
Your plan will send you a membership package with enrollment materials and a health insurance card as proof of your insurance. You'll use the card when you get health care services, so keep it in a safe place.
Carefully review these, and look through your plan's provider directory to see where you can get care.
If you didn't receive a card, call your insurer to see if you should have received one already and to make sure your coverage is effective. You can find your insurer's phone number on their website.

You’re considered self-employed if you have a business that takes in income but doesn’t have any employees.
You can enroll through the Marketplace if you’re a freelancer, consultant, independent contractor, or other self-employed worker who doesn’t have any employees. If your business has even one employee (other than yourself, a spouse, family member, or owner), you may be able to use the SHOP Marketplace for small businesses to offer coverage to yourself and your employees. See "How do I know if I’m self-employed or a small employer?" to learn more.
Coverage options for the self-employed

When you fill out a Marketplace application, you’ll find out if you qualify for premium tax credits and other savings on a health plan. This will be based on your income and household size.
You’ll also find out if you qualify for free or low-cost coverage through the Medicaid and CHIP programs in your state. This will depend on your income, household size, and other factors.
Do a quick check to see if your expected income is in the range to save.

In the Marketplace you can choose from several categories of coverage, from plans with low premiums that mainly protect you in worst-case scenarios to plans where you’ll pay more each month but less out-of-pocket when you get health care services.

Self-employment income and Marketplace savings
 When you fill out a Health Insurance Marketplace® application, you’ll have to estimate your net self-employment income. Marketplace savings are based on your estimated net income for the year you’re getting coverage, not last year’s income.
When you’re self-employed, it can be hard to estimate your income for the coming months or year. Learn how to estimate your income if you’re self-employed.

Learn more about how to apply with a Special Enrollment Period.

In rare cases, your employer’s coverage won’t be considered affordable to you or won’t meet minimum standards. If this is true, you may qualify for premium tax credits and other savings on a Marketplace plan based on your income. Learn about your options if you have an offer of job-based coverage.

What if I’m self-employed and my spouse has coverage through a job?Open

What if I have COBRA coverage?Open
If you currently have COBRA continuation coverage, your options are different during the annual health insurance Open Enrollment period and outside Open Enrollment. Learn about COBRA and the Marketplace.

If you just lost your job and your job-based insuranceOpen
If you have just left your job for any reason and lost your job-based health coverage, you qualify for a Special Enrollment Period.

Your options depend on your household income
When you apply for Marketplace coverage you’ll estimate your income for the current calendar year.
How to estimate your income if you’re unemployedOpen
It’s hard to predict your annual income if you’re unemployed. Still, it’s important to make your best estimate based on all current or expected sources of income for the year.
Types of income to include on your application:
Unemployment compensation that you receive from your state. Visit CareerOneStop's Unemployment Benefits FinderExternal Link for more information about unemployment in your state.
All household members’ income (not just yours)
Additional types of income, including interest income, capital gains, and alimony
Most withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401ks. (But see IRS Form 8606 instructions (PDF) for information on non-deductible contributions, and IRS Publication 590-B (PDF) for information on Roth accounts.)
Learn about income sources the Marketplace considers for everybody.
Note: It’s very important to immediately update your income information with the Marketplace if your income changes during the year. This will ensure you get the right amount of savings based on your new annual income estimate.
Medicaid, CHIP, and insurance plans through the Marketplace
When you fill out a Marketplace application, you’ll find out if you qualify for any of these types of coverage:
A Marketplace insurance plan. You may qualify for premium tax credits and savings on deductibles, copayments, and other out-of-pocket costs based on your household size and income. Some people with low incomes may wind up paying very small premiums. Learn about getting lower costs on a Marketplace insurance plan.
Medicaid. Medicaid provides coverage to millions of Americans with limited incomes or disabilities. Many states have expanded Medicaid to cover all people below certain income levels. Learn more about Medicaid and how to apply.
Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). CHIP provides coverage for children, and in some states pregnant women, in families with incomes too high for Medicaid but too low to afford private insurance. Learn more about CHIP.
After you finish your Marketplace application, you’ll get an eligibility determination that tells you what kind of coverage you and others in your household qualify for.

Withdrawals from a traditional IRA or SEP-IRA generally count as income. (If you made only tax-deductible contributions, all of it is considered income. If you made non-deductible contributions, see IRS Form 8606 (PDF).
Roth IRAs are different. Qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are not considered income. For more information, see IRS Publication 590.
Withdrawals from a 401k plan are generally counted as income (your pre-tax contributions, an employer’s matching contributions, as well as earnings, are included in income). But qualified distributions from a designated Roth account in a 401(k) plan are not considered income. For more information, see IRS Publication 575.

Get options if you're retired but don’t have Medicare coverage.
Can I choose Marketplace coverage instead of Medicare?Open
Generally, no. It’s against the law for someone who knows you have Medicare to sell you a Marketplace plan.
But there are a few situations where you can choose a Marketplace private health plan instead of Medicare:
If you’re paying a premium for Part A (Hospital Insurance). In this case you can drop Part A and Part B (Medical Insurance) and get a Marketplace plan instead.
If you’re eligible for Medicare but haven’t signed up. This could be because:
You’d have to pay a premium for Part A.
You have a medical condition that qualifies you for Medicare, like End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), but haven’t signed up for Medicare coverage.
You’re not collecting Social Security retirement or disability benefits before you’re eligible for Medicare.
If you’re getting Social Security retirement or disability benefits before you’re eligible for Medicare, you’ll automatically get Medicare when eligible.
Before choosing a Marketplace plan over Medicare, there are 2 important points to consider:
If you want to sign up for Medicare after you're first eligible, you may have to wait until the General Enrollment Period (January 1-March 31 each year) to sign up. This means you have have months without medical coverage.
In most cases, you'll also have to pay monthly late enrollment penalties. The penalty is added to your monthly premiums, and it goes up the longer you wait.
If you can't afford the monthly premiums, there are programs to help lower the costs. Learn about Medicare cost saving programs.
Get details about signing up for Medicare.
Can I get a Marketplace plan in addition to Medicare?Open
No. It’s against the law for someone who knows that you have Medicare to sell or issue you a Marketplace policy. This is true even if you have only Medicare Part A or only Part B.
If you want coverage that helps pay your out-of-pocket costs in Medicare Part A and Part B, you can buy a Medigap policy. You can also add Medicare drug coverage (Part D). Or to get some extra benefits, like vision, hearing, dental, and more. These “bundled” plans include Part A, Part B and usually Part D.
Discover your Medicare coverage options.
I turn 65 in the middle of the year. Can I get Marketplace coverage until I’m eligible for Medicare?Open
Yes. You can get a Marketplace plan to cover you before your Medicare begins. You can then cancel the Marketplace plan once your Medicare coverage starts.
Get details about changing from the Marketplace to Medicare.
If I have Medicare, can I get a stand-alone dental plan through the Marketplace?Open
In most cases, no. If the Marketplace in your state is run by the federal government, you won’t be able buy a stand-alone dental plan unless you’re also buying a health plan. If your state is running its own Marketplace, you may be able to buy a stand-alone dental plan. Find out if your state runs its own Marketplace.
Is prescription drug coverage through the Marketplace considered "creditable drug coverage" for Medicare Part D?Open
While prescription drug coverage is an essential health benefit, prescription drug coverage in a Marketplace or SHOP health plan doesn't have to provide the same value (creditable coverage) as Medicare Part D coverage.
But all private plans offering prescription drug coverage, including Marketplace and SHOP plans, must tell you in writing if their prescription drug coverage is creditable each year.
Learn more about creditable coverage.
If I’m getting health coverage from an employer through the SHOP Marketplace, can I delay signing up for Medicare Part B without a penalty?Open
Yes. You can delay Part B enrollment if you’re getting health coverage through the SHOP Marketplace based on your or your spouse’s job.
You have a special enrollment period to sign up for Part B without penalty:
Any time you’re still covered by the job-based health plan based on your or your spouse’s current employment
During the 8-month period that begins the month after the job or the coverage ends, whichever happens first
Notice: 
If you don’t sign up during this Special Enrollment Period, you’ll have to wait to sign up and go months without coverage. You might also pay a monthly penalty for as long as you have Part B. The penalty goes up the longer you wait to sign up.

If I have Medicare, can I get health coverage from an employer through the SHOP Marketplace?Open
Yes. Coverage from an employer through the SHOP Marketplace is treated the same as coverage from any job-based health plan. If you’re getting health coverage from an employer through the SHOP Marketplace based on your or your spouse’s current job, Medicare Secondary Payer rules apply.

What’s on Form 1095-A and why you need it
Your 1095-A contains information about Marketplace plans any member of your household had in 2022, including:
Premiums paid
Premium tax credits used
A figure called “second lowest cost Silver plan” (SLCSP)The second-lowest priced Marketplace health insurance plan in the Silver category that applies to you. It may not be the plan you enrolled in. You need to know your second lowest cost Silver plan (SLCSP) premium to figure out your final premium tax credit. In most cases, you’ll find your SLCSP premium on Form 1095-A.Refer to glossary for more details.

You’ll use information from your 1095-A to fill out Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit (PDF, 110 KB). This is how you'll "reconcileHow you find out if you used the right amount of premium tax credit during the year. To reconcile, you compare two amounts: the premium tax credit you used in advance during the year; and the amount of tax credit you qualify for based on your final income. You’ll use IRS Form 8962 to do this. If you used more premium tax credit than you qualify for, you’ll pay the difference with your federal taxes. If you used less, you’ll get the difference as a credit.Refer to glossary for more details." — find out if there's any difference between the premium tax credit you used and the amount you qualify for.
If you had Marketplace coverage but didn't take advance payments of the premium tax creditA tax credit you can take in advance to lower your monthly health insurance payment (or “premium”). When you apply for coverage in the Health Insurance Marketplace®, you estimate your expected income for the year. If you qualify for a premium tax credit based on your estimate, you can use any amount of the credit in advance to lower your premium.Refer to glossary for more details..
Learn more about the 1095-A from the IRS.
How to check Form 1095-A for accuracy & what to do if it's wrong
Carefully read the instructions on the back.
Make sure it’s accurate. If anything about your coverage or household is wrong, contact the Marketplace Call Center. Think the "monthly enrollment premium" may be wrong? Read this before contacting the Call Center.
Make sure the information about the “second lowest cost Silver Plan” (SLCSP) is correct.
How to know if your SLCSP information is correct
Look at Part III, column B of your 1095-A, titled “Monthly second lowest cost silver plan (SLCSP) premium.” It should show figures for each month any household member had the Marketplace plan.
The SLCSP premium is incorrect if:
Part III, Column B has a “0” or is blank for any month someone in your household had the Marketplace plan
You had changes in your household that you didn’t tell the Marketplace about — like having a baby, moving, getting married or divorced, or losing a dependent
If either applies to you, you’ll use our tax tool to get the premium for your second lowest cost Silver plan.
Use the information from your 1095-A to “reconcile”
Once you have an accurate 1095-A and second lowest cost Silver plan premium, you’re ready to fill out Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit.

More Answers: Form 1095-A
Why would I get more than one 1095-A?Open
Probably because one of these applies:
You changed Marketplace plans during the year
You updated your application with new information — like adding or removing a family member, or moving — that resulted in a new enrollment in your plan
Different household members had different plans
If there are more than 5 members on the same plan
If you think you should have more than one 1095-A but don’t, or if any information looks incorrect, contact the Marketplace Call Center.
What if I paid full price for a Marketplace plan?Open
You’ll get a 1095-A too. Part III, Column C should be blank or have the number “0.”
If you want to check if you qualify for a premium tax credit based on your final income, you can complete Form 8962 to find out. If you don't qualify for a premium tax credit, you don't have to include Form 8962 when you file your income taxes.
Learn more about your taxes if you paid full price for a Marketplace plan.
What if I had a Marketplace plan for part of the year?Open
Your 1095-A should include information for only the months you had a Marketplace plan. If you think it’s wrong, contact the Marketplace Call Center.
What if I think my monthly enrollment premium is wrong?Open
The "monthly enrollment premium" on Form 1095-A (Part III, Column A) may be different from the monthly premium you paid. This doesn’t always mean there are errors, because:
Your plan included benefits in addition to the essential health benefits required by the health care law, like adult dental or vision benefits. In this case, the monthly enrollment premium on your Form 1095-A may show only the amount of your premium that applied to essential health benefits.
You or a household member started or ended coverage mid-month. In this case, your Form 1095-A will show only the premium for the parts of the month coverage was provided.
You were enrolled in a stand-alone dental plan and a dependent under 18 was enrolled in it. In this case, the monthly enrollment premium on your Form 1095-A may be higher than you expect because it includes a portion of the dental plan premiums for pediatric benefits.
If any of these applied, the premium on your 1095-A is probably correct. If you still think it's wrong, contact the Marketplace Call Center. If the form has errors, you'll be sent a corrected version.
What if I get a corrected 1095-A, but already filed my tax return using an earlier version of the form?Open
You may need to file an amended return using the information on your corrected 1095-A. Get more tax filling details from the IRS.
How do I find a 1095-A for a previous year?Open
Follow these steps, but in step 2, choose your application for a previous year.

Check out if you qualify

Life changes that can qualify you for a Special Enrollment Period
Changes in household
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if in the past 60 days you or anyone in your household:
Got married. Pick a plan by the last day of the month and your coverage can start the first day of the next month.
Had a baby, adopted a child, or placed a child for foster care. Your coverage can start the day of the event — even if you enroll in the plan up to 60 days afterward.
Got divorced or legally separated and lost health insurance. Note: Divorce or legal separation without losing coverage doesn’t qualify you for a Special Enrollment Period.
Died. You’ll qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if someone on your Marketplace plan dies which causes you to lose your current health plan.
Changes in residence
You may qualify you for a Special Enrollment Period if you move to:
New home in a new ZIP code or county
The U.S. from a foreign country or United States territory
Or, move to or from:
Place you attend school (if you're a student)
Place you both live and work (if you're a seasonal worker)
Shelter or other transitional housing
Moving only for medical treatment or staying somewhere for vacation doesn’t qualify you for a Special Enrollment Period.
You must prove you had qualifying health coverage for one or more days during the 60 days before your move. You don't need to provide proof if you’re moving from a foreign country or United States territory.
Loss of health insurance
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you or anyone in your household lost qualifying health coverage in the past 60 days OR expects to lose coverage in the next 60 days.
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you lost:
Job-based coverageOpen
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you lose health coverage through your employer or the employer of a family member, including if you lose health coverage through a parent or guardian because you're no longer a dependent.
Notice: 
Voluntarily dropping coverage you have as a dependent doesn't qualify you for a Special Enrollment Period unless you also had a decrease in household income or a change in your previous coverage that made you eligible for savings on a Marketplace plan.

Individual health coverageOpen
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you lose individual health coverage, including if:
Your individual plan or your Marketplace plan is discontinued (no longer exists).
You lose eligibility for a student health plan.
You lose eligibility for a plan because you no longer live in the plan’s service area.
Your individual or group health plan coverage year is ending in the middle of the calendar year and you choose not to renew it.

Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage (or were denied Medicaid/CHIP)Open
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you lost Medicaid or CHIP since March 31, 2023.
You may also qualify if you lose or were denied Medicaid or CHIP coverage because:
You're no longer eligible. Like if you had a change in household income that makes you ineligible for Medicaid.
Your child ages off CHIP.
You applied for Medicaid/CHIP or Marketplace coverage during Open Enrollment or with a different Special Enrollment period and were told you might be eligible for Medicaid/CHIP. But, when your state agency told you that you weren’t eligible, Open Enrollment or your Special Enrollment Period had already ended.
Eligibility for MedicareOpen
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you lose premium-free Medicare Part A.
You don’t qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you lose:
Medicare Part A because you didn’t pay your Medicare premium.
Medicare Parts B or D only.
Coverage through a family memberOpen
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you lose qualifying health coverage you had through a parent, spouse, or other family member. This might happen if you lose health coverage because:
You turn 26 (or the maximum dependent age allowed in your state) and can no longer be on a parent’s plan.
A family member loses health coverage or coverage for their dependents.
A divorce or legal separation.
The death of a family member.
You’re no longer a dependent.
You won’t qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you chose to drop the coverage you have as a dependent, unless you also had a decrease in household income or a change in your previous coverage that made you eligible for savings on a Marketplace plan.
 
An employer offer to help with the cost of coverage
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you (or anyone in your household) were offered an individual coverage HRA or a Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement (QSEHRA) in the past 60 days OR expects to in the next 60 days.
Note: Your employer may refer to an individual coverage HRA by a different name, like the acronym “ICHRA.”

Notice: 
IMPORTANT: You can’t buy a Marketplace dental plan unless you’re buying a health plan at the same time.

Dental coverage is available 2 ways

Health plans with dental coverage: Some Marketplace health plans have dental coverage. You can see which plans include dental coverage when you compare them.
	If a health plan includes dental, the premium covers both health and dental coverage.


Separate dental plans: In some cases, separate dental plans are offered. You can see them when you shop for plans in the Marketplace.
	If you pick a separate dental plan, you’ll pay a separate premium. This is in addition to the premium you pay for your Marketplace health plan.

SEE HEALTH AND DENTAL PLANS & PRICES

Dental plan categories: High and low
There are 2 categories of Marketplace dental plans: High and low.
High coverage level has higher premiumsThe amount you pay for your health insurance every month. In addition to your premium, you usually have to pay other costs for your health care, including a deductible, copayments, and coinsurance. If you have a Marketplace health plan, you may be able to lower your costs with a premium tax credit.Refer to glossary for more details. but lower copaymentsA fixed amount ($20, for example) you pay for a covered health care service after you've paid your deductible.Refer to glossary for more details. and deductiblesThe amount you pay for covered health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. With a $2,000 deductible, for example, you pay the first $2,000 of covered services yourself.Refer to glossary for more details.. So you'll pay more every month, but less when you get dental services.
Low coverage level has lower premiums but higher copayments and deductibles. So you’ll pay less every month, but more when you get dental services.
When you compare dental plans in the Marketplace, you’ll find details about each plan’s costs, copayments, deductibles, and services covered.
Adult & child dental insurance in the Marketplace
Dental insurance is treated differently for adults and children 18 and under.

Dental coverage is an essential health benefit for children. This means if you’re getting health coverage for someone 18 or younger, dental coverage must be available for your child either as part of a health plan or as a separate dental plan.
Note: While dental coverage for children must be available to you, you don’t have to buy it.


Dental coverage isn't an essential health benefit for adults. Health plans don’t have to offer adult dental coverage.

Some states expanded their Medicaid programs to cover all people below certain income levels.
Notice: 
Check if you qualify based on income
Enter your household size and state, and we'll tell you if you may qualify for Medicaid or savings on a Marketplace plan.
Find out now

Even if you don't qualify for Medicaid based on income, you should apply. You may qualify for your state's program, especially if you have children, are pregnant, or have a disability. You can apply for Medicaid and CHIP any time of year.

Apply for Medicaid and CHIP 2 ways
1. Fill out an application through the Marketplace
If it looks like anyone in your household qualifies for Medicaid or CHIP, we’ll send your information to your state agency. They’ll contact you about enrollment.
When you submit your Marketplace application, you’ll also find out if you qualify for cost savings on a Marketplace plan. Plans may be more affordable than you think.
Create an account to start a Marketplace application.
2. Or, apply directly through your state Medicaid agency
Select your state below to get your Medicaid agency’s contact information.

Medicaid & CHIP basics
Medicaid basicsOpen
In all states, Medicaid provides coverage for some low-income people, families and children, pregnant people, the elderly, and people with disabilities.
Some states expanded their Medicaid program to cover all adults below a certain income level. Learn more about Medicaid expansion and what it means for you.
Medicaid programs must follow federal guidelines, but coverage and costs may be different from state to state.
Some Medicaid programs pay for your care directly. Others use private insurance companies to provide Medicaid coverage.
Medicaid may be able to help you pay for medical care from the last 3 months, even if you weren’t enrolled in Medicaid at the time you got medical care. Payment depends on your family’s income at the time.
Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) basicsOpen
In all states, CHIP provides low-cost health coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid. In some states, CHIP covers pregnant people.
Each state works closely with its state Medicaid program.
In many cases, if you qualify for savings on a Marketplace plan, your children will qualify for either Medicaid or CHIP.
Learn more about CHIP.
More answers: Medicaid & CHIP
What services does Medicaid cover?Open
Medicaid benefits are different in each state. But all states provide comprehensive coverage. Get a list of services Medicaid offers in all states.
What’s the income level to qualify for Medicaid?Open
It depends on the state you live in.
If your state has expanded Medicaid: Check if your income qualifies.
If your state has not expanded Medicaid: You may qualify based on your state’s existing rules. Rules vary from state to state and may take into account income, household size, family status (like pregnancy or caring for young children), disability, age, and other factors. Because each state and each family situation is different, there’s no way to find out if you qualify without filling out an application.
If my income’s too high for Medicaid, can I buy insurance through the Marketplace?Open
Generally yes, as long as you qualify to use the Marketplace. Most people whose incomes are just above the level to qualify for Medicaid can pay very low premiums and out-of-pocket costs for private health insurance through the Marketplace. Check if you’ll qualify for savings.
What if I'm eligible for Medicaid, but want to get Marketplace coverage instead?Open
A Marketplace health plan would cost more than Medicaid and usually wouldn’t offer more coverage or benefits. If you qualify for Medicaid, you aren’t eligible for savings on a Marketplace plan. You’d have to pay full price for a plan.
What if I have Medicaid now, but I have only limited benefits?Open
Some limited types of Medicaid coverage pay only for:
Family planning
Treatment of an emergency medical condition
Tuberculosis services
If you have limited Medicaid coverage, you can fill out an application through the Marketplace and find out if you qualify for full-benefit coverage through either Medicaid or a Marketplace insurance plan with savings based on your income.
Notice: 
If you have limited Medicaid coverage, don’t check the box saying you have Medicaid when you're asked if you have coverage now in the Marketplace application. Instead, check “None of the above.”

What rules apply to former foster children and Medicaid?Open
All states must offer former foster children uninterrupted Medicaid coverage until they turn 26, as long as at least one of the following is true:
They were in the foster care system and received Medicaid benefits on their 18th birthday
They aged out of the foster care system with Medicaid coverage after they were 18 or older
For former foster children who turned 18 on or after January 1, 2023, states must offer the same Medicaid coverage to individuals regardless of the state in which they aged out of foster care. Some states also cover former foster children who turned 18 before January 1, 2023, from other states. Check with your state Medicaid agency to learn more.
What if I’ve been turned down for Medicaid or CHIP coverage?Open
You may be able to get Marketplace coverage instead. You may qualify for a premium tax credit or other cost savings for a Marketplace plan. Four in five customers are able to find health coverage for $10 or less a month.
If your state Medicaid or CHIP agency said you’re not eligible
If your state agency said someone in your household isn’t eligible, you’ll get a notice explaining this.
In most cases, the state will securely send your information to the Marketplace. We'll send you a letter about applying for Marketplace coverage. You can apply for Marketplace coverage by logging into your Marketplace account. Your application will be pre-filled with information you gave the state agency.
If your state hasn't expanded Medicaid coverage
If your state hasn’t expanded Medicaid and your state agency said you’re not eligible under its current rules, you may have fewer options for coverage. Depending on your income you may not qualify for savings on a private insurance plan.
Learn about your options if you’re in this situation.

How to Choose a Plan in
the Health Insurance
Marketplace®

Choosing a health insurance plan can be complicated. Knowing just a few things before you compare plans can make it simpler.

The 4 “metal” categories: There are 4 categories of health insurance plans: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. These categories show how you and your plan share costs. Plan categories have nothing to do with quality of care.


Your total costs for health care: You pay a monthly bill to your insurance company (a "premium"), even if you don’t use medical services that month. You pay out-of-pocket costs, including a deductibleThe amount you pay for covered health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. With a $2,000 deductible, for example, you pay the first $2,000 of covered services yourself.Refer to glossary for more details., when you get care. It’s important to think about both kinds of costs when shopping for a plan.


Plan and network types — HMOA type of health insurance plan that usually limits coverage to care from doctors who work for or contract with the HMO. It generally won't cover out-of-network care except in an emergency. An HMO may require you to live or work in its service area to be eligible for coverage. HMOs often provide integrated care and focus on prevention and wellness.Refer to glossary for more details., PPOA type of health plan that contracts with medical providers, such as hospitals and doctors, to create a network of participating providers. You pay less if you use providers that belong to the plan’s network. You can use doctors, hospitals, and providers outside of the network for an additional cost.Refer to glossary for more details., POSA type of plan in which you pay less if you use doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers that belong to the plan’s network. POS plans also require you to get a referral from your primary care doctor in order to see a specialist.Refer to glossary for more details., and EPOA managed care plan where services are covered only if you go to doctors, specialists, or hospitals in the plan’s network (except in an emergency).Refer to glossary for more details.: Some plan types allow you to use almost any doctor or health care facility. Others limit your choices or charge you more if you use providers outside their network.



Remember that plans also may differ in quality. Learn more about quality ratings.

If your income estimate goes down or you gain a household member:

You could qualify for more savings than you’re getting now. This could lower what you pay in monthly premiums.
You could qualify for free or low-cost coverage through Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

The amount of your premium tax credit depends on the estimated household income for 2023 that you put on your Marketplace application.
Find out if your estimated 2023 income is in the range to qualify for a premium tax credit.
You can apply some or all of this tax credit to your monthly insurance premium payment. The Marketplace will send your tax credit directly to your insurance company, so you’ll pay less each month. This is called taking an "advance payment of the premium tax credit."
When your income changes, so does your premium tax credit
If your income changes, or if you add or lose members of your household, your premium tax credit will probably change too.
It’s very important to report income and household changes to the Marketplace as soon as possible.
If your income goes up or you lose a member of your household: You’ll probably qualify for a lower premium tax credit. You may want to reduce the amount of tax credit you take in advance each month. This way you don’t wind up taking more credits than you qualify for.
If your income goes down or you gain a household member: You’ll probably qualify for a bigger premium tax credit. You may want to increase the amount of tax credit you take in advance so you have a lower premium bill each month.
Note: If your income is within a certain range, you may be able to enroll in or change Marketplace coverage through a new Special Enrollment PeriodA time outside the yearly Open Enrollment Period when you can sign up for health insurance. You qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you’ve had certain life events, including losing health coverage, moving, getting married, having a baby, or adopting a child, or if your household income is below a certain amount.Refer to glossary for more details. based on estimated household income. Learn more.
Notice: 
IMPORTANT
If at the end of the year you’ve taken more advance payments of the premium tax credit than you’re eligible for, you may have to pay money back when you file your federal income tax return. This is called “reconciling” the advance payments of the premium tax credit and the actual premium tax credit you qualify for based on your final 2023 income.

You’ll also find out if your income qualifies you for extra savings known as “cost-sharing reductionsA discount that lowers the amount you have to pay for deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. In the Health Insurance Marketplace®, cost-sharing reductions are often called “extra savings.” If you qualify, you must enroll in a plan in the Silver category to get the extra savings.Refer to glossary for more details.. ” If it does, you can save money a second way: by paying less out of pocket each time you get medical services.
Notice: 
Getting extra savings with a Silver plan
If you qualify for cost-sharing reductions: You must pick a plan in the Silver categoryOne of 4 categories of Health Insurance Marketplace® plans (sometimes called “metal levels”). Silver plans fall about in the middle: You pay moderate monthly premiums and moderate costs when you need care. Important: If you qualify for “cost sharing reductions” (or “extra savings”) you can save a lot of money on deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance when you get care — but only if you pick a Silver plan.Refer to glossary for more details. to get these extra savings on out-of-pocket costs.
If you enroll in a plan in another health plan category, you can still use a premium tax credit. But, you won’t get these extra savings.
Silver plans may also be available if you’re eligible for a premium tax credit and can enroll through a Special Enrollment Period based on estimated household income.

If you’re enrolled in a Silver plan and lose your cost-sharing reductions: You’ll qualify for a Special Enrollment Period. If you want to change plans, you can enroll in a Bronze, Silver or Gold plan that meets your needs and fits your budget.

Do you qualify for cost-sharing reductions?
Use this quick tool to see if your 2023 income estimate falls in the range for cost-sharing reductions.
If it does fall in the range, the amount you'll save on out-of-pocket costs depends on your specific income estimate. The lower your income within the range, the more you'll save.
You'll find out exactly how much you'll save only after you apply and shop for Silver plans in the Marketplace.
How cost-sharing reductions work
If you qualify for savings on out-of-pocket costs and enroll in a Silver plan:
You'll have a lower deductible. This means the insurance plan starts to pay its share of your medical costs sooner. For example, if a particular Silver plan has a $750 deductible, you have to pay the first $750 of medical care yourself before the insurance company pays anything (other than for free preventive services). But if you qualify for cost-sharing reductions, your deductible for a Silver plan could be $300 or $500, depending on your income.
You'll have lower copayments or coinsurance. These are the payments you make each time you get care — like $30 for a doctor visit. If a Silver plan's copayment is $30 for a doctor's visit, if you enroll in the plan and qualify for extra savings, you may pay $20 or $15 instead.
You'll have a lower "out-of-pocket maximum." This means the total amount you'd have to pay in a year if you used a lot of care, like if you got seriously sick or had an accident, would be lower. Instead of $5,000, your out-of-pocket maximum for a particular Silver plan could be $3,000.
Note: These examples explain how cost-sharing reductions work. Your costs will vary depending on which plan you pick.
Plans in all categories have a wide range of deductibles, copayments/coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximums. You'll know exactly how much you save on out-of-pocket costs only when you shop for Silver plans in the Marketplace.

How will I find out if I qualify for cost-sharing reductions?Open
After you apply for Marketplace coverage, check your Eligibility Determination Notice. If it says "Can choose a health plan with lower copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles" and is followed by (04), (05), or (06), you qualify for income-based savings — but only if you pick a Silver plan.
If I choose a Catastrophic plan will I qualify for savings on out-of-pocket costs?Open
No. Cost-sharing reductions apply only to Silver plans. (Catastrophic plans are also not eligible for a premium tax credit, no matter what your income is.)

The monthly premium is usually lower, but you pay more health care costs yourself before the insurance company starts to pay its share (your deductible). A high deductible plan (HDHP) can be combined with a health savings account (HSA), allowing you to pay for certain medical expenses with money free from federal taxes.Refer to glossary for more details. in combination with opening a Health Savings Account (HSA)A type of savings account that lets you set aside money on a pre-tax basis to pay for qualified medical expenses. By using untaxed dollars in a Health Savings Account (HSA) to pay for deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and some other expenses, you may be able to lower your overall health care costs. HSA funds generally may not be used to pay premiums.Refer to glossary for more details..
How High Deductible Health Plans and Health Savings Accounts can reduce your costs
If you enroll in an HDHP, you may pay a lower monthly premium but have a higher deductibleThe amount you pay for covered health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. With a $2,000 deductible, for example, you pay the first $2,000 of covered services yourself.Refer to glossary for more details. (meaning you pay for more of your health care items and services before the insurance plan pays).
If you combine your HDHP with an HSA, you can pay that deductible, plus other qualified medical expenses, using money you set aside in your tax-free HSA.
So if you have an HDHP and don’t need many health care items and services, you may benefit from a lower monthly premium. If you need more care, you’ll save by using the tax-free money in your HSA to pay for it.
Your HSA balance rolls over year to year, so you can build up reserves to pay for health care items and services you need later.
What’s considered a High Deductible Health Plan?
Under the tax law, HDHPs must set a minimum deductible and a limit, or maximum, on out-of-pocket costs.
For calendar year 2023, these amounts for HDHPs are:
  Minimum deductible (The amount you pay for health care items and services before your plan starts to pay)Maximum out-of-pocket costs (The most you’d have to pay if you need more health care items and services)
Individual HDHP

$1,500

$7,500

Family HDHP

$3,000

$15,000
HDHP deductibles are often significantly higher than the minimums shown above and can be as high as the maximum out-of-pocket costs shown above.

Two important things to know:
Marketplace savings are based on your expected household income for the year you want coverage, not last year’s income.
Income is counted for you, your spouse, and everyone you'll claim as a tax dependent on your federal tax return (if the dependents are required to fileThe minimum income requiring a dependent to file a federal tax return. 2022 filing requirements for dependents under 65: Earned income of at least $12,950, or unearned income (like from investments or trusts) of at least $1,150. You must include on your Marketplace application income for any dependent required to file.Refer to glossary for more details.). Include their income even if they don’t need health coverage. See details on who to include in your household.
How to make an estimate of your expected income
Step 1. Start with your household’s adjusted gross income (AGI)Your total (or “gross”) income for the tax year, minus certain adjustments you’re allowed to take. Adjustments include deductions for conventional IRA contributions, student loan interest, and more. Adjusted gross income appears on IRS Form 1040, line 11.Refer to glossary for more details. from your most recent federal income tax return.
Don’t have recent AGI? See another way to estimate your income.
Step 2. Add the following kinds of income, if you have any, to your AGI:
Tax-exempt foreign income
Tax-exempt Social Security benefits (including tier 1 railroad retirement benefits)
Tax-exempt interest
Don’t include Supplemental Security Income (SSI).
Step 3. Adjust your estimate for any changes you expect.
Consider things like these for all members of your household:
Expected raises
New jobs or other employment changes, including changes to work schedule or self-employment income
Changes to income from other sources, like Social Security or investments
Changes in your household, like gaining or losing dependents. Gaining or losing a dependent can have a big impact on your savings.
Now you have an estimate of your expected income.

Estimating unpredictable income
It’s hard to predict your income if you’re unemployed, self-employed, on commission, or on a work schedule that changes regularly.
If your income is hard to predict, base your estimate on your past experience, recent trends, what you know about possible changes at your workplace, and similar information. If the job is new to you, ask people in the same field or in the same company about their experiences.

How do I upload documents to verify my income for the Marketplace?Open
If the Marketplace tells you to provide pay stubs, self-employment records, or other information to verify your income, follow these directions to upload documents.
What is "MAGI," and do I need to use it for anything?Open
The Heath Insurance Marketplace uses an income figure called Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)The figure used to determine eligibility for premium tax credits and other savings for Marketplace health insurance plans and for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). MAGI is adjusted gross income (AGI) plus these, if any: untaxed foreign income, non-taxable Social Security benefits, and tax-exempt interest.Refer to glossary for more details. to determine the programs and savings you qualify for. For most people, it’s identical or very close to Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). MAGI is not a line on your federal tax return.
The estimate instructions above are based on MAGI, but it’s not a term you need to know in order to apply or use tools on this site.
What if I don’t know my household’s recent Adjusted Gross Income?Open
Start with “federal taxable wages” for each income earner in your household.
You should find this amount on your pay stub.
If it's not on your pay stub, use gross income before taxes. Then subtract any money the employer takes out for health coverage, child care, or retirement savings.
Multiply federal taxable wages by the number of paychecks you expect in the tax year to estimate your income.
See what other household income sources to include.
Adjust all income amounts for expected changes during the year.
Why do I need to include people in my household who don’t need insurance?Open
Marketplace savings are based on income for all household members, not just the ones who need insurance.
If anyone in your household has coverage through a job-based plan, a plan they bought themselves, a public program like Medicaid, CHIP, or Medicare, or another source, include them and their income on your application.
When you apply you’ll say which household members need coverage.
What if my household income changes during the year?Open
Report income and household changes on your Marketplace insurance application as soon as possible. If you don’t, you could wind up with the wrong amount of savings or even the wrong insurance plan. Learn how to update your income during the year.
Are income and household rules the same for Marketplace insurance plans and Medicaid coverage?Open
There are some differences, depending on your state and other factors. The Marketplace application may ask you specific questions to see if you’re eligible for Medicaid. If it looks like anyone in your household qualifies for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), we’ll send your application to your state agency. They may ask you for more information. If it turns out you’re eligible, they’ll help you enroll.

Warning: Important: You must pay your premium for your coverage to start
Once you enroll in a plan, you'll pay your premiums directly to the insurance company — not to the Health Insurance Marketplace®. Your coverage won't start until you pay your first premium. Make sure you continue to pay your monthly premiums to your health insurance company on time. If you don't, the insurance company could end your coverage.


How to pay your monthly premium at HealthCare.gov
Log in to your Marketplace account.
Choose your application under "Your Existing Applications."
Click the blue button "Pay Your First Health Insurance Monthly Premium."
If online payment is available, choose the green button "Pay for Health Plan Now" to go to your insurance company’s website to pay. 
Note: If your health insurance company doesn't accept online payment, they should have contacted you with next steps. Reach out to them if you haven’t received details on how to pay or aren’t sure that you paid. For their phone number, check out your plan brochure or go to their website.
How to tell if your health insurance is active
If you're not sure you're enrolled, check your online Marketplace account. If you think you're enrolled but have questions about your plan, you can reference your plan materials.
How to verify your enrollment online
Log in to your HealthCare.gov account.
Select your completed application under "Your Existing Applications."
Click on "My Plans & Programs" to see which plan(s) you're enrolled in. Here you'll see a summary of your coverage. Your coverage start date depends on when you enrolled or changed plans.
If you don't see your summary or still aren't sure you finished enrollment, call your insurance company. They can confirm if you enrolled and paid your first premium.
If you're still having issues, contact the Marketplace Call Center.
How to access your plan enrollment materials
Your plan will send you a membership package with enrollment materials and a health insurance card as proof of your insurance. You'll use the card when you get health care services, so keep it in a safe place.
Carefully review these, and look through your plan's provider directory to see where you can get care.
If you didn't receive a card, call your insurer to see if you should have received one already and to make sure your coverage is effective. You can find your insurer's phone number on their website.

Had a baby, adopted a child, or placed a child for foster care. Your coverage can start the day of the event — even if you enroll in the plan up to 60 days afterward.

Changes in residence
You may qualify you for a Special Enrollment Period if you move to:

Medicare Part A because you didn’t pay your Medicare premium.

A family member loses health coverage or coverage for their dependents.
A divorce or legal separation.
The death of a family member.
You’re no longer a dependent.
You won’t qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you chose to drop the coverage you have as a dependent, unless you also had a decrease in household income or a change in your previous coverage that made you eligible for savings on a Marketplace plan.
 
An employer offer to help with the cost of coverage
You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you (or anyone in your household) were offered an individual coverage HRA or a Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement (QSEHRA) in the past 60 days OR expects to in the next 60 days.

Medicaid and CHIP
If your income is low or you have certain life situations, you could qualify for free or low-cost coverage through Medicaid.

In all states, you can qualify based on factors including income, some family situations like pregnancy and having young children, and disability.
If you have children, they might qualify for coverage under the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) — even if you don't qualify for Medicaid.
Fill out a Marketplace application any time of year to find out if you qualify for Medicaid and CHIP. Get started now.

You’re considered self-employed if you have a business that takes in income but doesn’t have any employees.
You can enroll through the Marketplace if you’re a freelancer, consultant, independent contractor, or other self-employed worker who doesn’t have any employees. If your business has even one employee (other than yourself, a spouse, family member, or owner), you may be able to use the SHOP Marketplace for small businesses to offer coverage to yourself and your employees. See "How do I know if I’m self-employed or a small employer?" to learn more.
Coverage options for the self-employed

When you fill out a Marketplace application, you’ll find out if you qualify for premium tax credits and other savings on a health plan. This will be based on your income and household size.
You’ll also find out if you qualify for free or low-cost coverage through the Medicaid and CHIP programs in your state. This will depend on your income, household size, and other factors.
Do a quick check to see if your expected income is in the range to save.

In the Marketplace you can choose from several categories of coverage, from plans with low premiums that mainly protect you in worst-case scenarios to plans where you’ll pay more each month but less out-of-pocket when you get health care services.

Self-employment income and Marketplace savings
 When you fill out a Health Insurance Marketplace® application, you’ll have to estimate your net self-employment income. Marketplace savings are based on your estimated net income for the year you’re getting coverage, not last year’s income.
When you’re self-employed, it can be hard to estimate your income for the coming months or year. Learn how to estimate your income if you’re self-employed.

How to estimate your income if you’re unemployedOpen
It’s hard to predict your annual income if you’re unemployed. Still, it’s important to make your best estimate based on all current or expected sources of income for the year.
Types of income to include on your application:
Unemployment compensation that you receive from your state. Visit CareerOneStop's Unemployment Benefits FinderExternal Link for more information about unemployment in your state.
All household members’ income (not just yours)
Additional types of income, including interest income, capital gains, and alimony
Most withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401ks. (But see IRS Form 8606 instructions (PDF) for information on non-deductible contributions, and IRS Publication 590-B (PDF) for information on Roth accounts.)
Learn about income sources the Marketplace considers for everybody.
Note: It’s very important to immediately update your income information with the Marketplace if your income changes during the year. This will ensure you get the right amount of savings based on your new annual income estimate.
Medicaid, CHIP, and insurance plans through the Marketplace
When you fill out a Marketplace application, you’ll find out if you qualify for any of these types of coverage:
A Marketplace insurance plan. You may qualify for premium tax credits and savings on deductibles, copayments, and other out-of-pocket costs based on your household size and income. Some people with low incomes may wind up paying very small premiums. Learn about getting lower costs on a Marketplace insurance plan.
Medicaid. Medicaid provides coverage to millions of Americans with limited incomes or disabilities. Many states have expanded Medicaid to cover all people below certain income levels. Learn more about Medicaid and how to apply.
Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). CHIP provides coverage for children, and in some states pregnant women, in families with incomes too high for Medicaid but too low to afford private insurance. Learn more about CHIP.
After you finish your Marketplace application, you’ll get an eligibility determination that tells you what kind of coverage you and others in your household qualify for.
More answers
Does unemployment compensation count as income?Open

Learn about how to estimate your income.
If I make withdrawals from my IRA or 401k, does this count as income?Open
It depends on the kind of account you’re withdrawing from. Generally, the amount of your income from a retirement account distribution depends on the type of retirement account, how much you contributed to it, and whether you were already taxed on the amount you contributed.
Withdrawals from a traditional IRA or SEP-IRA generally count as income. (If you made only tax-deductible contributions, all of it is considered income. If you made non-deductible contributions, see IRS Form 8606 (PDF).
Roth IRAs are different. Qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are not considered income. For more information, see IRS Publication 590.
Withdrawals from a 401k plan are generally counted as income (your pre-tax contributions, an employer’s matching contributions, as well as earnings, are included in income). But qualified distributions from a designated Roth account in a 401(k) plan are not considered income. For more information, see IRS Publication 575.

If you have an exemption, you don’t need to pay the fee for being uncovered when you file 2018 taxes in the spring. Note: Starting with the 2019 plan year (for which you’ll file taxes in April 2020), the fee no longer applies. You won't need an exemption for 2019 and beyond.

The Marketplace won’t affect your Medicare choices or benefits. No matter how you get Medicare, whether through Original Medicare or a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO), you won’t have to make any changes.
Notice: 
IMPORTANT
The Marketplace doesn’t offer Medicare supplement (Medigap) insurance or Part D drug plans.

Expanded Medicare benefits for preventive care, drug coverage
Medicare benefits have expanded under the health care law – things like free preventive benefits, cancer screenings, and an annual wellness visit.
You can also save money if you’re in the prescription drug “donut hole”Most plans with Medicare prescription drug coverage (Part D) have a coverage gap (called a "donut hole"). This means that after you and your drug plan have spent a certain amount of money for covered drugs, you have to pay all costs out-of-pocket for your prescriptions up to a yearly limit. Once you have spent up to the yearly limit, your coverage gap ends and your drug plan helps pay for covered drugs again.Refer to glossary for more details. with discounts on brand-name prescription drugs.

Can I choose Marketplace coverage instead of Medicare?Open
Generally, no. It’s against the law for someone who knows you have Medicare to sell you a Marketplace plan.
But there are a few situations where you can choose a Marketplace private health plan instead of Medicare:
If you’re paying a premium for Part A (Hospital Insurance). In this case you can drop Part A and Part B (Medical Insurance) and get a Marketplace plan instead.
If you’re eligible for Medicare but haven’t signed up. This could be because:
You’d have to pay a premium for Part A.
You have a medical condition that qualifies you for Medicare, like End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), but haven’t signed up for Medicare coverage.
You’re not collecting Social Security retirement or disability benefits before you’re eligible for Medicare.
If you’re getting Social Security retirement or disability benefits before you’re eligible for Medicare, you’ll automatically get Medicare when eligible.
Before choosing a Marketplace plan over Medicare, there are 2 important points to consider:
If you want to sign up for Medicare after you're first eligible, you may have to wait until the General Enrollment Period (January 1-March 31 each year) to sign up. This means you have have months without medical coverage.
In most cases, you'll also have to pay monthly late enrollment penalties. The penalty is added to your monthly premiums, and it goes up the longer you wait.
If you can't afford the monthly premiums, there are programs to help lower the costs. Learn about Medicare cost saving programs.
Get details about signing up for Medicare.
Can I get a Marketplace plan in addition to Medicare?Open
No. It’s against the law for someone who knows that you have Medicare to sell or issue you a Marketplace policy. This is true even if you have only Medicare Part A or only Part B.
If you want coverage that helps pay your out-of-pocket costs in Medicare Part A and Part B, you can buy a Medigap policy. You can also add Medicare drug coverage (Part D). Or to get some extra benefits, like vision, hearing, dental, and more. These “bundled” plans include Part A, Part B and usually Part D.
Discover your Medicare coverage options.
I turn 65 in the middle of the year. Can I get Marketplace coverage until I’m eligible for Medicare?Open
Yes. You can get a Marketplace plan to cover you before your Medicare begins. You can then cancel the Marketplace plan once your Medicare coverage starts.
Get details about changing from the Marketplace to Medicare.
If I have Medicare, can I get a stand-alone dental plan through the Marketplace?Open
In most cases, no. If the Marketplace in your state is run by the federal government, you won’t be able buy a stand-alone dental plan unless you’re also buying a health plan. If your state is running its own Marketplace, you may be able to buy a stand-alone dental plan. Find out if your state runs its own Marketplace.
Is prescription drug coverage through the Marketplace considered "creditable drug coverage" for Medicare Part D?Open
While prescription drug coverage is an essential health benefit, prescription drug coverage in a Marketplace or SHOP health plan doesn't have to provide the same value (creditable coverage) as Medicare Part D coverage.
But all private plans offering prescription drug coverage, including Marketplace and SHOP plans, must tell you in writing if their prescription drug coverage is creditable each year.
Learn more about creditable coverage.
If I’m getting health coverage from an employer through the SHOP Marketplace, can I delay signing up for Medicare Part B without a penalty?Open
Yes. You can delay Part B enrollment if you’re getting health coverage through the SHOP Marketplace based on your or your spouse’s job.
You have a special enrollment period to sign up for Part B without penalty:
Any time you’re still covered by the job-based health plan based on your or your spouse’s current employment
During the 8-month period that begins the month after the job or the coverage ends, whichever happens first
Notice: 
If you don’t sign up during this Special Enrollment Period, you’ll have to wait to sign up and go months without coverage. You might also pay a monthly penalty for as long as you have Part B. The penalty goes up the longer you wait to sign up.

If I have Medicare, can I get health coverage from an employer through the SHOP Marketplace?Open
Yes. Coverage from an employer through the SHOP Marketplace is treated the same as coverage from any job-based health plan. If you’re getting health coverage from an employer through the SHOP Marketplace based on your or your spouse’s current job, Medicare Secondary Payer rules apply.

How to check Form 1095-A for accuracy & what to do if it's wrong
Carefully read the instructions on the back.
Make sure it’s accurate. If anything about your coverage or household is wrong, contact the Marketplace Call Center. Think the "monthly enrollment premium" may be wrong? Read this before contacting the Call Center.

How to know if your SLCSP information is correct
Look at Part III, column B of your 1095-A, titled “Monthly second lowest cost silver plan (SLCSP) premium.” It should show figures for each month any household member had the Marketplace plan.
The SLCSP premium is incorrect if:
Part III, Column B has a “0” or is blank for any month someone in your household had the Marketplace plan
You had changes in your household that you didn’t tell the Marketplace about — like having a baby, moving, getting married or divorced, or losing a dependent
If either applies to you, you’ll use our tax tool to get the premium for your second lowest cost Silver plan.

More Answers: Form 1095-A
Why would I get more than one 1095-A?Open
Probably because one of these applies:
You changed Marketplace plans during the year
You updated your application with new information — like adding or removing a family member, or moving — that resulted in a new enrollment in your plan
Different household members had different plans
If there are more than 5 members on the same plan
If you think you should have more than one 1095-A but don’t, or if any information looks incorrect, contact the Marketplace Call Center.
What if I paid full price for a Marketplace plan?Open
You’ll get a 1095-A too. Part III, Column C should be blank or have the number “0.”
If you want to check if you qualify for a premium tax credit based on your final income, you can complete Form 8962 to find out. If you don't qualify for a premium tax credit, you don't have to include Form 8962 when you file your income taxes.
Learn more about your taxes if you paid full price for a Marketplace plan.
What if I had a Marketplace plan for part of the year?Open
Your 1095-A should include information for only the months you had a Marketplace plan. If you think it’s wrong, contact the Marketplace Call Center.
What if I think my monthly enrollment premium is wrong?Open
The "monthly enrollment premium" on Form 1095-A (Part III, Column A) may be different from the monthly premium you paid. This doesn’t always mean there are errors, because:
Your plan included benefits in addition to the essential health benefits required by the health care law, like adult dental or vision benefits. In this case, the monthly enrollment premium on your Form 1095-A may show only the amount of your premium that applied to essential health benefits.
You or a household member started or ended coverage mid-month. In this case, your Form 1095-A will show only the premium for the parts of the month coverage was provided.
You were enrolled in a stand-alone dental plan and a dependent under 18 was enrolled in it. In this case, the monthly enrollment premium on your Form 1095-A may be higher than you expect because it includes a portion of the dental plan premiums for pediatric benefits.
If any of these applied, the premium on your 1095-A is probably correct. If you still think it's wrong, contact the Marketplace Call Center. If the form has errors, you'll be sent a corrected version.
What if I get a corrected 1095-A, but already filed my tax return using an earlier version of the form?Open
You may need to file an amended return using the information on your corrected 1095-A. Get more tax filling details from the IRS.
How do I find a 1095-A for a previous year?Open
Follow these steps, but in step 2, choose your application for a previous year.

States are now returning to normal operations, so your state will start checking eligibility for these programs again. Your state will reach out to you if they need more information to check if you're still eligible to keep your coverage. You can prepare by updating your contact information with your state and checking your mail for a letter from your state. Complete and submit any forms your state asks for right away.
If your state finds that your household income is too high or other changes make you ineligible, you may lose your Medicaid or CHIP coverage.
The Marketplace may contact you. When you lose Medicaid or CHIP coverage, your state securely sends your contact information to the Marketplace. We’ll use it to mail you a letter about Marketplace coverage. We may also follow up with you by phone, text, or email, if you gave that contact information to your state. You don’t need to wait for us to contact you to apply for coverage.
Apply for Marketplace coverage right away
You may be able to get low-cost, quality health coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace®A service that helps people shop for and enroll in health insurance. The federal government operates the Health Insurance Marketplace®, available at HealthCare.gov, for most states. Some states run their own Marketplaces.Refer to glossary for more details..
All Marketplace plans cover things like prescription drugs, doctor visits, urgent care, hospital visits, and more.
You can apply and enroll in a Marketplace plan as early as 60 days before your Medicaid or CHIP coverage ends to avoid a gap in coverage. Between March 31, 2023 and July 31, 2024, you can also apply for a Marketplace plan anytime after your Medicaid or CHIP coverage ends and you will have 60 days after submitting your application to enroll in a plan that will start at the beginning of the next month after you complete your enrollment.
Most people qualify for savings
When you apply to the Marketplace, you’ll find out if you qualify for:
Savings, like a tax creditA tax credit you can take in advance to lower your monthly health insurance payment (or “premium”). When you apply for coverage in the Health Insurance Marketplace®, you estimate your expected income for the year. If you qualify for a premium tax credit based on your estimate, you can use any amount of the credit in advance to lower your premium.Refer to glossary for more details. that lowers your monthly premium
Extra savings (called “cost-sharing reductionsA discount that lowers the amount you have to pay for deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. In the Health Insurance Marketplace®, cost-sharing reductions are often called “extra savings.” If you qualify, you must enroll in a plan in the Silver category to get the extra savings.Refer to glossary for more details.”) to lower what you pay when you get services, like deductiblesThe amount you pay for covered health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. With a $2,000 deductible, for example, you pay the first $2,000 of covered services yourself.Refer to glossary for more details. and copaysA fixed amount ($20, for example) you pay for a covered health care service after you've paid your deductible.Refer to glossary for more details..
To apply, you’ll first create an account (or log into your account if you already have one).
Start/update an application
Local help in your community
About a month after we send you the first letter, if you haven’t enrolled in coverage, we may send you another letter with information about an assister organization that works with us to help your local community. Marketplace assisters provide free, fair, impartial, and accurate information to you and your household.
A Marketplace assister in your community may contact you by phone, text, or email with the information you provided to your state Medicaid or CHIP agency. Assisters are trained by us to give you information about your health coverage options, answer your questions, and help you enroll in a Marketplace plan, Medicaid, or CHIP. Assisters will:
Never ask you for your credit card number or any other form of payment
Their services to help you get health coverage are free of charge
When you enroll in a health plan, you’ll always pay your premiums directly to the insurance company – never to the Marketplace or its assisters.

Always provide a Privacy Notice Statement, and get your consent or “authorization” before discussing or accessing your personal information
What do I do if someone contacts me and says they’re a Marketplace assister?Open
Confirm who they are before providing any information. Ask for their name, who they work for, and their organization’s phone number, street address, mailing address, email address, and website. Write this information down. Compare it to the organization listed in the letter you got from the Marketplace.
Get more ways to verify a Marketplace assister.
You can also call the Marketplace Call Center any time for help with Marketplace coverage.
To get help with your coverage options or to apply for Marketplace coverage, find local help near you or contact the Marketplace Call Center.
Warning: 
Say no to scams
Don’t share your personal information or give money to anyone saying you have to pay them to keep Medicaid or CHIP coverage or apply for Marketplace coverage. The Marketplace, assister organizations, and your state will never threaten you or anyone in your household or ask for your credit card information or payment to keep or qualify for health coverage.
Report it if someone calls, emails, or texts you asking for:
Your personal information (like your Social Security Number)
Money (like credit card payment, gift cards, cash, prepaid debit card, or cryptocurrency)
Or, if they threaten you or anyone in your household with legal action
Report it to the Federal Trade Commission. Also contact your local police department. Learn more about scams.

Re-apply if you lost or will soon lose Medicaid or CHIP
If your state says you’re no longer eligible for Medicaid or CHIP coverage, you can re-apply through your state to find out if you still qualify. (In all states, Medicaid and CHIP offers health coverage to some low-income people, families and children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with disabilities.)
Check with your employer about job-based coverage
Your employer may offer health insurance. If they do, find out how to decide between job-based or Marketplace coverage.

Warning: Important: You must pay your premium for your coverage to start
Once you enroll in a plan, you'll pay your premiums directly to the insurance company — not to the Health Insurance Marketplace®. Your coverage won't start until you pay your first premium. Make sure you continue to pay your monthly premiums to your health insurance company on time. If you don't, the insurance company could end your coverage.


How to pay your monthly premium at HealthCare.gov
Log in to your Marketplace account.
Choose your application under "Your Existing Applications."
Click the blue button "Pay Your First Health Insurance Monthly Premium."
If online payment is available, choose the green button "Pay for Health Plan Now" to go to your insurance company’s website to pay. 
Note: If your health insurance company doesn't accept online payment, they should have contacted you with next steps. Reach out to them if you haven’t received details on how to pay or aren’t sure that you paid. For their phone number, check out your plan brochure or go to their website.
How to tell if your health insurance is active
If you're not sure you're enrolled, check your online Marketplace account. If you think you're enrolled but have questions about your plan, you can reference your plan materials.
How to verify your enrollment online
Log in to your HealthCare.gov account.
Select your completed application under "Your Existing Applications."
Click on "My Plans & Programs" to see which plan(s) you're enrolled in. Here you'll see a summary of your coverage. Your coverage start date depends on when you enrolled or changed plans.
If you don't see your summary or still aren't sure you finished enrollment, call your insurance company. They can confirm if you enrolled and paid your first premium.
If you're still having issues, contact the Marketplace Call Center.
How to access your plan enrollment materials
Your plan will send you a membership package with enrollment materials and a health insurance card as proof of your insurance. You'll use the card when you get health care services, so keep it in a safe place.
Carefully review these, and look through your plan's provider directory to see where you can get care.
If you didn't receive a card, call your insurer to see if you should have received one already and to make sure your coverage is effective. You can find your insurer's phone number on their website.

Information which you may provide
When you request information:
We collect information including your email address or mobile phone number to deliver alerts or e-newsletters. We use this information to complete the subscription process and provide you with information. You can opt out of these communications at any time by editing your subscription preferences.
When you apply for health insurance coverage:
To establish an account on HealthCare.gov, we collect information like your first and last name, your email address, and your responses to three questions used for password recovery. We use this information to establish and maintain your account to login and utilize HealthCare.gov. We use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add security to your HealthCare.gov account and ensure you as the authorized user are the only person who can access it. If you agree to use MFA, we collect your phone number or your email address. We use this information to send a code by text message, email, or phone call. Visit granicus.com/wireless/healthcareExternal Link for more information on how this works. Then, when you begin the application process, we collect information from you that is used to verify your identity. The Health Insurance Marketplace® contracts with Experian and Symantec to verify the information you disclose as part of this identity proofing and authentication process.
On HealthCare.gov, we provide streamlined applications that allow you to apply for affordable health insurance coverage. When you apply using one of these forms, we collect personally identifiable information about you and are authorized to maintain a record of the information related to your application.
After you complete an application, some of your application information may be disclosed to other federal agencies so that your eligibility for affordable health insurance can be determined. These organizations may include the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Defense (DoD)/TRICARE, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), state Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) agencies, and Equifax Workforce Solutions, with which the Marketplace engages in an electronic verification process authorized by the Affordable Care Act. Some of your information may also be verified against data provided to the Marketplace by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Peace Corps if necessary to verify whether you are eligible for or enrolled in Minimal Essential Coverage (MEC). Your information may also be shared with the employer(s) listed on your application for the limited purposes of verifying whether you are eligible for or enrolled in employer-sponsored coverage or advance premium tax credits.
In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, a system of records has been created for the collection of personally identifiable information you submit to HealthCare.gov. The original system of records notice entitled, “Health Insurance Exchanges (HIX) Program” was published in the Federal Register on February 6, 2013. This notice was amended on May 29, 2013 and on October 23, 2013. The system of records and modifications can be found at: http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Computer-Data-and-Systems/Privacy/CMS-Systems-of-Records.html.

How the Health Insurance Marketplace® uses information it collects
When processing your application after you apply for health insurance coverage
We use the application information you choose to provide to determine eligibility for enrollment in a qualified health plan through the Marketplace, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), advance premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions, and certifications of exemption from the individual shared responsibility requirement. We also verify the information provided on the application, communicate with you or your authorized representative and provide the information to the health plan you select so that it can enroll you in a qualified health plan. If you submitted your Marketplace application through the website of an agent, broker or a health insurance company and not through HealthCare.gov, we will also communicate with the entity you applied or enrolled with regarding your application and supply them with your eligibility determination and other related information. You can find more information about how we use the information you provide on the application in the Privacy Act Statements at the following links:
Individuals and Families
Agents and Brokers
Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) for Employers
You can learn more about how we handle your information at https://www.healthcare.gov/how-we-use-your-data.
When sending you Marketplace messages
The Marketplace uses the email address (or mobile phone number) you provide us to send emails or Short Message Service (SMS) messages related to HealthCare.gov, if you have given us permission to send you such emails and text messages. The Marketplace also may use the phone number you provided to us (or was sent to us by your state) to call or SMS/text you about Marketplace coverage.
When calling about your application or account
The Marketplace uses the phone number you provided us to communicate important information about your application or account. Periodically, you may receive prerecorded phone calls from the Marketplace. If you want to stop receiving notifications in the form of prerecorded phone calls, contact the Marketplace Call Center at 1-800-318-2596 and ask to be added to our do not call list. TTY users can call 1-855-889-4325. After we update your account, a Marketplace representative may still call you if there is an issue with your account or health plan, including if:
A technical error occurred when you applied on HealthCare.gov — you probably got an error message when completing your application — that prevented:
	You from enrolling in a plan, or
Your health insurance company from receiving your enrollment information

The Marketplace needs more information to verify or add to information you entered on your application about your income, citizenship, immigration status, identity, or something else. We do this when some information you provided doesn’t match our records. (Note: This is sometimes called a "data matching issue" or "inconsistency," but both terms mean the same thing.) The Marketplace won’t end health insurance or change savings based on health insurance data matching issues without giving you advance notice. You'll get three warning notices and a reminder phone call before coverage ends or your savings change because of a data matching issue
Your health insurance company is no longer offering your plan through the Marketplace
When getting your health coverage application from state Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
When a state Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) transfers a health coverage application for you and your household members to the Marketplace, it may be due to ineligibility for Medicaid/CHIP coverage. However, you may be eligible for Marketplace coverage. The Marketplace processes the information we get to help you apply for and enroll in Marketplace coverage. The Marketplace may send you a letter and conduct outreach by phone, or send you email or SMS text messages based on the communication preferences included in your transferred application, if any. The communication is to let you know we've gotten your application and to help you transition to the Marketplace and find out what you may be eligible for.
In addition, the Marketplace may share your contact information from your transferred application with enrollment assistance contractors and Marketplace-certified grantees for the purposes of conducting outreach on behalf of the Marketplace and to help you with next steps in completing your Marketplace application and enrolling in coverage, if eligible. The Marketplace assisters may use your contact information to reach out to you and offer help with applying and enrolling in Marketplace coverage. You don't have to work with the Marketplace assister who may contact you. You can use HealthCare.gov, call the Marketplace Call Center, use Find Local Help to choose a different assister or find an agent/broker, or use a certified enrollment partner website to complete your Marketplace application and enroll in coverage. If you are contacted and want to confirm the person is certified and registered with the Marketplace, you can call the Marketplace Call Center for assistance at 1-800-318-2596. TTY users can call 1-855-889-4325.
When conducting surveys and improving services
The Marketplace also uses online surveys to collect opinions and feedback. You don’t have to answer these questions. If you do answer these questions, do not include any personally identifiable information in your answers. We analyze and use the information from these surveys to improve the site’s operation and content. The information is available only to Marketplace managers, members of the Marketplace communications and web teams, and other designated federal staff and contractors who require this information to perform their duties.
When using third-party tools for website analytics
The Marketplace uses a variety of third-party web analytics tools to collect basic information about visits to HealthCare.gov. This information is then used to maintain the website including: monitoring site stability, measuring site traffic, optimizing site content, and may help make the site more useful to visitors.
Marketplace staff analyzes the data collected from these tools. The reports are available only to Marketplace managers, teams who implement Federally Facilitated Marketplaces programs represented on HealthCare.gov, members of the Marketplace communications and web teams, and other designated federal staff and contractors who need this information to perform their duties.
When using third-party tools for outreach through digital advertising
The Marketplace uses third-party web services to conduct outreach and education through the use of digital advertising for the Marketplace. These third-party services may collect information through the use of web beacons that are located on our pages. A web beacon is a see-through graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a web page and, in combination with a cookie, allows us to collect information regarding the use of the web page that contains the web beacon.
We use web beacons to tell when a user is redirected to HealthCare.gov because of a Marketplace advertisement that we ran on another website was clicked on or otherwise interacted with (known as “click tracking” or “conversion tracking”) and to better target Marketplace advertisements (known as “retargeting”) to inform citizens about Marketplace deadlines and the benefits available through HealthCare.gov. Go to How the Health Insurance Marketplace® uses third-party websites and applications below for more information on how these tools work.
The Marketplace uses third-party tools to help deliver advertising. Vendors that operate the third-party tools may also gather information about your visits to third-party sites outside of HealthCare.gov. However, while the Marketplace doesn't track your individual-level activity on the Internet outside of HealthCare.gov, our vendors may collect information automatically collected by HealthCare.gov (not information you provide), and combine it with data they collect elsewhere for targeted advertising purposes. You can opt out of this type of data collection via Privacy Settings, Ad Choices, and Do Not Track. Go to Your Choices about tracking and data collection below for methods to opt out of this type of collection. The outreach and education analytics tools provide reports which aggregate data like the number of clicks on advertisements. The reports are available only to Marketplace managers, teams who implement the insurance affordability programs represented on HealthCare.gov, members of the HealthCare.gov communications and web teams, and other designated federal staff and contractors who need this information to perform their duties.

How the Health Insurance Marketplace® uses cookies and other technologies
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies, allows federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies to improve the delivery of services.
When you visit a website, its server may generate a piece of text known as a "cookie" to place on your device. The cookie, which is unique to your browser, allows the server to "remember" specific information about your visit while you are connected. The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of web pages. Information that you enter into the application isn't associated with cookies on HealthCare.gov. Depending on the third-party tool’s business practices, privacy policies, terms of service, and/or the privacy settings you selected, information you have provided to third parties could be used to identify you when you visit HealthCare.gov. These third parties don't/won't share your identity with CMS or Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
There are two types of cookies, single session (temporary), and multi-session (persistent). Single session cookies last only as long as your web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the session cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your device for longer periods. Both types of cookies create an ID that is unique to your device.
Session cookies: We use session cookies for technical purposes like to allow better navigation through our site. These cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to our site. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as "Usage Tier 1—Single Session.” The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of single session web measurement and customization technologies."
Persistent cookies: We use persistent cookies to understand the differences between new and returning visitors to HealthCare.gov. Persistent cookies remain on your device between visits to our site until they expire or are removed by the user. The OMB Memorandum 10-22 Guidance defines our use of persistent cookies as "Usage Tier 2—Multi-session without personally identifiable information.” The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of multi-session web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected." We don't use persistent cookies to collect personally identifiable information. CMS does not identify a user by using such technologies.
The Marketplace also uses the following technologies:
Persistent cookies for digital advertising: Similar to persistent cookies identified above, the Marketplace uses persistent cookies for outreach through digital advertising. These cookies can also be created on third-party sites and remain on your device between visits to our site until they expire or are removed by you. Consistent with OMB guidance for “Usage Tier 2”, we don't use persistent cookies for outreach to collect personally identifiable information. The Marketplace doesn't identify a user by using such technologies.
Web beacons for digital advertising: Also referred to as pixels and\or tracking tags – see-through images placed on certain pages of HealthCare.gov are typically used in conjunction with cookies and aren't stored on your device. When you access these pages, web beacons generate a notice of your visit. Go to the section How the Marketplace uses third-party websites and applications for information on how we use web beacons.
Website log files: Are used as an analysis tool and to tell how visitors use HealthCare.gov, how often they return, and how they navigate through the site.
Flash: Flash is used to assess the performance of the site and as a player for selected videos depending on the browser a device is using.
Local storage objects: We use Flash Local Storage Objects (“LSOs”) to store your preferences and to personalize your visit.

Your choices about tracking and data collection
The Health Insurance Marketplace® offers Privacy Settings which give you control over what tracking and data collection takes place during your visit. Third-party tools are enabled by default to provide a quality consumer experience.
The Privacy Settings provide you with the choice to opt-in or to opt-out of the different categories of third-party tools used by HealthCare.gov: Advertising, Analytics, or Social Media. The Privacy Settings prevent cookies, web beacons, and Local Storage Objects from being placed on your device. The Privacy Settings also prevent third-party tools from loading regardless of your cookie settings, which provides consumers with an additional layer of privacy that prevents the tool from loading at all. Because the Privacy Settings create a cookie in your browser, the opt-in and opt-out choices you make through the Privacy Settings will only be effective on the device and browser you used to make your choices, and your choices will expire when the cookie expires. Once the cookie is created, the Privacy Settings will retain your choices for 3 years from the date of your most recent visit. You may revisit the Privacy Settings to change or renew your choices at any time.
Modify Privacy Options
Note that if you disable cookies in your browser, Privacy Settings won't be able to store your preferences and won't function properly. If you don't wish to use our Privacy Settings to opt-out of the tools used by HealthCare.gov, you can opt-out of tools individually, or via the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) AdChoices icon, discussed in the next subsection.
Go to the list of third-party tools for more information on how to opt-out individually to each service.
If you opt out of the tools used by the Marketplace via the Privacy Settings or by opting out of the tools directly, you will still have access to information and resources at HealthCare.gov. Alternatively, if you don't want to use the website, you can use the call center to apply
AdChoices: The Marketplace includes the Ad Choices icon on all digital advertising that uses “conversion-tracking” or “re-targeting”. Go to How the Marketplace uses third-party websites and applications to learn about conversion tracking, targeted advertising, and retargeting. The AdChoices icon is usually at or near the corner of digital ads. When you click on the AdChoices icon it will provide information on what company served the ad and information on how to opt-out. For more information on AdChoices, visit the AdChoices websiteExternal Link.
Do Not Track: The Marketplace automatically observes the "Do Not Track" browser setting for digital advertising that uses "conversion-tracking" or "re-targeting". If "Do Not Track" is set before a device visits HealthCare.gov, third-party conversion tracking and retargeting tools won't load on the site. Go to How the Health Insurance Marketplace® uses third-party websites and applications to learn about conversion tracking and retargeting. For more information on Do Not Track or information on how to set the Do Not Track setting in your browser go to the Do Not Track websiteExternal Link.

How the Health Insurance Marketplace® uses third-party websites and applications
As a response to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo M-10-06, Open Government Directive, the HealthCare.gov site leverages a variety of technologies and social media services to communicate and interact with the public. These third-party websites and applications include popular social networking and media sites, open source software communities, and more.
Third-party websites
Your activity on the third-party websites that HealthCare.gov links to (like Facebook or Twitter) is governed by the security and privacy policies of those websites. You should review the privacy policies of all websites before using them so that you understand how your information may be used. You should also adjust privacy settings on your account on any third-party website to match your preferences.
Help On Demand
The Marketplace has contracted with Help On Demand (formerly known as BigWave Systems) to provide consumers access to Help On Demand, a service that connects consumers with Marketplace-registered and state-licensed insurance agents/brokers for assistance with obtaining eligibility determinations and enrollment in coverage. The service is a real-time referral system that allows consumers to request assistance from participating agents/ brokers in their area who can provide immediate assistance. Consumers who want assistance with completing an application on HealthCare.gov can navigate to the Help On Demand service by completing the online form or clicking on a hyperlink. If they choose to navigate to Help On Demand, they’re interacting with a website that is operated by a CMS contractor and a referral service that then provides their information directly to a Marketplace-registered insurance agent/ broker. Therefore, consumers using the service are subject to the security standards and privacy policies of the Help On Demand service. The Help On Demand website will display a detailed privacy notice as well as terms of use, which will govern users' activity on the website. Users should review this content before using Help On Demand to understand how their information may be used. For more information on this service, go to the CMS Privacy Impact Assessment for Help On Demand (PDF, 94 KB).
Enhanced Direct Enrollment
CMS, as operator of the Marketplace, manages and oversees an Enhanced Direct Enrollment (EDE) program that establishes agreements with qualified EDE partners, which include certain insurance companies and licensed agents and brokers that use their own websites to facilitate enrollment in Marketplace qualified health plans. These agreements authorize EDE partners to submit consumer application information collected directly from consumers to the Marketplace for an eligibility determination, without requiring consumers to submit Marketplace application information through HealthCare.gov. If you choose to apply for coverage through an EDE partner using its website, your activity on such a third-party website is governed by the security and privacy policies of the EDE partner and its website. Information needed to determine your eligibility status, your final eligibility determination, and other information related to your Marketplace application and enrollment will be shared between the EDE partner and CMS.
For more information on how your information is used and kept secure when you apply or enroll through an EDE partner without using HealthCare.gov, go to the CMS Privacy Impact Assessment for Enhanced Direct Enrollment Partner Websites.
Online appeals submission
The Marketplace has contracted with DocuSign Web Service, a service that provides consumers the ability to digitally sign and submit appeal request forms online to the Marketplace Appeals Center. Consumers that want to appeal a decision made by the Marketplace can submit their information into DocuSign, which is electronically sent to the Marketplace Appeals Center to be processed on. (Note: A copy of the appeal request is stored in DocuSign for 14 days before it is automatically deleted. This gives the Marketplace Appeals Center enough time to receive and process the request.) Consumers who want to submit their appeal request forms online can do so by selecting a hyperlink to a Marketplace Appeal Request Form website, operated by DocuSign, Inc. Once the consumer chooses to navigate to the DocuSign website, they are interacting with a third-party website that isn’t operated by the Marketplace, but provides their information directly to the Marketplace Appeals Center. Therefore, the consumer using the DocuSign service is subject to the security standards and privacy policies of the third-party website and DocuSign. The website will display a detailed privacy notice as well as terms of use which will govern users' activity on the website. Users should review this content before using the third-party website to understand how their information may be used. For more information on this service, go to the CMS Privacy Impact Assessment for DocuSign (PDF).
Website analytics tools
These tools collect basic site usage information such as: how many visits HealthCare.gov receives, the pages visited by consumers, time spent on the site, the number of return visits to the site, the approximate location of the device used to access the site, types of devices used, etc. This information is then used to maintain the website including: monitoring site stability, measuring site traffic, optimizing site content, and improving the consumer experience. Use the Marketplace Privacy Settings to opt-out of website analytics tools.
Digital advertising tools for outreach and education
The Marketplace uses third-party tools to support our digital advertising outreach and education efforts. These tools enable the Marketplace to reach new people and provide information to previous visitors. To use these tools, we use the following technologies on HealthCare.gov.
Click tracking: HealthCare.gov uses click tracking to identify the ads that are most helpful to consumers and efficient for outreach. This enables HealthCare.gov to improve the performance of ads that consumers click on. When users click on links from ads, data about what ad was viewed is collected. Reports are generated about ad performance – including the total number of views and clicks an ad received.
Conversion tracking: HealthCare.gov uses conversion tracking to identify ads that are helpful to consumers and efficient for outreach. It enables HealthCare.gov to improve the performance of ads viewed by consumers. When a HealthCare.gov ad is viewed on a third-party site (e.g. a banner ad), a cookie is placed in the browser of the device the ad was viewed on. If this device later visits HealthCare.gov, the visit is linked to the ad viewed on the same device. Use the Marketplace Privacy Settings to opt-out of advertising tools. Users can click on the “AdChoices” Icon in the corner of our Ads to opt-out of this Ad Targeting. Users who have set their browser to "Do Not Track" will automatically be opted out of conversion tracking. For more information about AdChoices and Do Not Track, go to "Your Choices about tracking and Data Collection."
Re-targeting: HealthCare.gov uses retargeting to provide information to consumers who have previously visited HealthCare.gov like reminders about upcoming enrollment deadlines. Retargeting enables the Marketplace to improve the performance of ads by delivering them to relevant audiences like recent visitors to HealthCare.gov. During a visit to HealthCare.gov, a cookie is placed in the browser of the devices used to view the site. When that same device is used to visit third-party sites that are displaying HealthCare.gov ads, ads for HealthCare.gov may be shown to that device because it had previously visited HealthCare.gov. Using these cookies, the Marketplace doesn't collect information about the third-party sites visited by a device. Reports are generated about ad performance – including the total number of views and clicks an ad received. Use the Marketplace Privacy Settings to opt-out of advertising tools. Users can click on the “AdChoices” Icon in the corner of our Ads to opt-out of this Ad Targeting. Users who have set their browser to “Do Not Track” will automatically be opt-ed out of conversion tracking. For more information about AdChoices and Do Not Track, go to Your Choices about Tracking and Data Collection.
Targeted advertising: The Marketplace uses third-party vendors to engage in targeted advertising (also known as online behavioral or interest-based advertising) to provide information to consumers across their online activities. Targeted advertising involves the collection of data from a particular computer or device. Data regarding web viewing behaviors or application use is gathered to predict user preferences or interests. The Marketplace can have ads delivered to computers or devices based on the preferences or interests inferred from the web viewing behaviors or application use.
Third-party vendors engaged by the Marketplace may also target advertising based on information automatically collected (not information you provide) when you browse the CMS websites or other websites on the internet. You can opt out this type of data collection via our Privacy Settings, Ad Choices, and Do Not Track. Go to Your Choices about Tracking and Data Collection above for methods to opt out of this type of collection.
The Marketplace may consider new third-party tools or the use of new third-party websites, but will first assess the tools or websites before it is used in connection with HealthCare.gov. The Marketplace will provide notice to the public before adding any new tool to HealthCare.gov. These assessments include a description about how information will be collected, accessed, secured, and stored. Get a list of the third-party tools currently being used on HealthCare.gov. Risk assessments for third-party websites and applications are available at http://www.hhs.gov/pia/.

How the Health Insurance Marketplace® protects your personal information
The Marketplace is committed to protecting consumer information entrusted with us. If you visit HealthCare.gov and choose to provide us with personally identifiable information through a request for information, paper or electronic form, application, questionnaire, survey, etc., we store your personally identifiable information in a record system designed to retrieve information about you by personal identifier (name, personal email address, home mailing address, personal or mobile phone number, etc.). We will safeguard the information you provide in accordance with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act and the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. Section 552a). CMS, the operator of HealthCare.gov, publishes System of Record Notices in the Federal Register for these record systems, and posts the System of Record Notices on CMS.gov.
The original system of records notice entitled, “Health Insurance Exchanges (HIX) Program” was published in the Federal Register on February 6, 2013. This notice was amended on May 29, 2013 and on October 23, 2013. The System of Records and modifications can be found at http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Computer-Data-and-Systems/Privacy/CMS-Systems-of-Records.html.
For further information about HealthCare.gov privacy policy, contact Privacy@cms.hhs.gov.
Third-party services are web-based technologies that are not exclusively operated or controlled by a government entity, or that involve significant participation of a nongovernment entity. These services may be separate websites or may be applications embedded within the Marketplace. The list of third-party services includes links to relevant third-party privacy policies.

How long the Health Insurance Marketplace® keeps data and how it is accessed
The Marketplace will keep data collected long enough to achieve the specified objective for which they were collected. Once the specified objective is achieved, the data will be retired or destroyed in accordance with published draft records schedules of CMS as approved by the National Archives and Records Administration.
The Marketplace doesn't store information from cookies on Marketplace systems. The persistent cookies used with third-party tools on HealthCare.gov can be stored on a user’s local system and are set to expire at varying time periods depending upon the cookie. The Marketplace assesses whether the expiration date of a cookie exceeds one year and provides an explanation as to why cookies with a longer life are used on the site in the associated Third-Party Website or Application Privacy Impact Assessment. These explanations can be found at http://www.hhs.gov/pia#Third-Party.

Children and privacy
We believe in the importance of protecting the privacy of children online. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) governs information gathered online from or about children under the age of 13. The HealthCare.gov site isn't intended to solicit information of any kind from children under age 13. If you believe that we have received information from a child under age 13, contact us at 1-800-318-2596 (TTY: 1-855-889-4325).

Links to other sites
HealthCare.gov may link to other government sites and/or to private organizations (like health care providers). We link to other websites solely for your convenience and education. When you follow a link to an external site, you're leaving HealthCare.gov and are subject to the external site’s privacy and security policies. Non-federal websites might not operate under the same laws, regulations, and policies as federal websites. Aside from third-party websites listed in this privacy notice, the Health Insurance Marketplace® isn't responsible for the contents of external web pages and a link to a page doesn't constitute an endorsement.

Don't forget to update your Marketplace application to get the best plan for your household, and the right amount of savings. 

Your next steps depend on where you move
When you move to a new state: 
You can't keep the same plan from your old state. Let the Marketplace know if you move to a different state right away, so you don't have a break in coverage or continue to pay for coverage that doesn't apply in your new state.
To get coverage in your new state, start a new Marketplace application and enroll in a plan in your new state. How you apply depends on whether your new state uses HealthCare.gov or its own website.
Apply for Marketplace coverage in your new state.
If you move within the same state:
Your coverage options and savings could change based on your new address.
Report your change of address to the Marketplace — we'll let you know if you need to pick a new plan.

Ensuring the Affordable Care Act Serves the American People
The Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) is charged with helping implement many reforms of the Affordable Care Act, the historic health reform bill that was signed into law March 23, 2010. CCIIO oversees the implementation of the provisions related to private health insurance. In particular, CCIIO is working with states to establish new Health Insurance Marketplaces.
CCIIO works closely with state regulators, consumers, and other stakeholders to ensure the Affordable Care Act best serves the American people.
Marketplace Resources
Further information for partners is available on the CMS Health Insurance Marketplace website.
Consumer friendly information about new coverage options through the Health Insurance Marketplace is available at www.HealthCare.gov - Opens in a new window .

Ending Surprise Medical Bills
Starting January 1, 2022, consumers have new billing protections when getting emergency care, non-emergency care from out-of-network providers at in-network facilities, and air ambulance services from out-of-network providers. Through new rules aimed to protect consumers, excessive out-of-pocket costs are restricted, and emergency services must continue to be covered without any prior authorization, and regardless of whether or not a provider or facility is in-network. See how new rules help protect people from surprise medical bills and remove consumers from payment disputes between a provider or health care facility and their health plan, visit: cms.gov/nosurprises.

Resources for Agents and Brokers in the Health Insurance Marketplaces
     	






 



Welcome
Welcome to the Agents and Brokers Resources webpage. This page is the primary outlet for agents and brokers to receive information from CMS about working in the Health Insurance Marketplace and the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP).
Thank you for Attending the 2023 CMS Agent and Broker Summit

Background
To the extent permitted by states, licensed agents and brokers may assist consumers determine their eligibility for insurance affordability programs, including advance payments of the premium tax credit and cost-sharing reductions, and enroll them in qualified health plans (QHPs).
Agents and brokers play a crucial role in educating consumers about the Health Insurance Marketplace, both during annual Open Enrollment and throughout the coverage year. Agents and brokers may also help employers understand their options for enrolling in SHOP coverage and assist them and their employees through the SHOP application and enrollment process.
Some states have set up their own State-based individual and small business Marketplaces, while the federal government runs the Individual Marketplace through HealthCare.gov and/or SHOP in other states. You can find out if a state is running its own Marketplace by visiting HealthCare.gov and selecting the state from the drop-down list. Agents and brokers can help consumers apply for and choose insurance options in any state in which the agents and brokers have an active state license that is approved for a health-related line of authority, regardless of whether the Marketplace is operated by the state or federal government.
Agents and brokers who wish to assist consumers in the Individual Marketplace on HealthCare.gov and/or SHOP must complete registration and required training on an annual basis—prior to assisting consumers enroll in a plan.
Plan Year 2024 Registration and Training is Live for New and Returning Agents and Brokers!
Plan Year 2024 Marketplace registration and training is now available for new and returning agents and brokers on the Marketplace Learning Management System (MLMS).
For more information on Plan Year 2024 registration and training, visit the Registration and Training page.

                  Find out how to register
                














Vote.gov helps you:




      Register to vote
    


All states except North Dakota require that you register before voting in an election. Select your state or territory from the dropdown menu to find the rules that apply to you.
U.S. citizens living outside the U.S., including U.S. service members and their families, can register to vote and request an absentee ballot by completing the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA). U.S. military family members, like everyone else, must meet U.S. voter eligibility requirements to register and request a ballot. For more information, visit the Federal Voter Assistance Program.



      Find voter registration deadlines
    


There is no national voter registration deadline. Voters in each state and territory must follow their voter registration laws. Select your state or territory from the dropdown menu to find your voter registration deadline.
Every state except North Dakota requires citizens to register if they want to vote. Some states require voters to register up to 30 days before an election, while others allow registration up to and on Election Day. It’s important you know the rules in your state.



      Check your registration
    


Select your state or territory from the dropdown menu to check your registration before your state’s deadline. That could be up to 30 days before the election.
Also check to see if your registration is marked “inactive.” You may become “inactive” if you did not vote in at least two federal elections and did not respond when election officials tried to reach you.
An inactive status does not necessarily mean that you need to re-register.  It means that you may have to take extra steps before you can vote. Your state election official’s office or your local election office can help you move your registration status back to active or answer questions you may have.
Make sure you are registered with the correct name, address, and political party affiliation. Visit your state’s registration page for information on how to update your voter registration information.



      Register after you’ve moved
    


Whether you’ve moved near or far, you need to update your voter registration after a change of address. Select your state or territory from the dropdown menu to learn how to register online or by mail. If your state has online voter registration, that may be the quickest way to make changes. Submit your changes before your state’s registration deadline, which can be up to 30 days before Election Day. Your state may also require a new driver’s license or ID card. See what type of voter ID your state requires.
Moving within your state
Even if you move within your same state, you’ll need to update your registration with your new address.
Moving to another state
Register before your new state’s deadline, which may be up to 30 days before the election. If you do not have time to register in your new state before Election Day, your old state may allow you to vote by mail or in person. For presidential election years, your old state must allow you to vote by mail or in person. After that, you’ll need to register in your new state.
Moving abroad
U.S. citizens living outside the U.S. can register to vote and request an absentee ballot by completing the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA). See the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) for more resources on military and overseas voting.



      Change your political party affiliation
    


Each state has a different process to select or change your party affiliation. Depending on your state, you may be asked for your party affiliation when you register to vote. Your state may not have political party affiliations for voters. Contact your state or local election office to see what the procedure is and if there are any deadlines for where you live. Selecting a party affiliation is not available in all states.
Regardless of which party you choose, the voting process is the same in a general election, which is when candidates are elected to offices. Your party affiliation impacts who you can vote for in primary elections and caucuses.



      Learn how to get a voter registration card
    


When you register to vote, you’ll be sent a voter registration card. This card confirms that you are registered and ready to vote. Your voter registration card typically includes your name, your home address, and the address of the polling station where you’ll vote. You can also look up your voter registration using your state’s voter registration lookup tool online.
If your name or address changes, you will need to update your voter registration. Once you’ve updated your voter registration information, you may receive a new voter registration card, depending on your state. If you have questions, your local election office is the best resource to help.
You do not usually need to have your voter registration card with you in order to vote, but you may need to present another form of ID to vote. Learn more about voter registration.

We’re telling you about our privacy policy so you know what information we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. This privacy notice is for HealthCare.gov, CuidadoDeSalud.gov, and other Healthcare.gov subdomains such as LocalHelp.HealthCare.gov. These sites are referred to as the "Health Insurance Marketplace®" or simply "Marketplace" throughout the rest of this notice and are maintained and operated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). This privacy notice aligns with the CMS Privacy Policy.
The Marketplace doesn't collect your name, contact information, Social Security Number or other similar information unless you choose to provide it. We do collect other limited information automatically from visitors who read, browse, and/or download information from our site. We do this so we can understand how the site is being used and how we can make it more helpful. Go to the Types of information we collect section below for more information.
Personally identifiable information (PII), defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), refers to information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, Social Security Number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc.
If you create a user account, fill out an application for health care coverage, and use other tools on the site (such as identity verification), the Marketplace collects personally identifiable information. This information is collected in order to provide the services the Marketplace is designed to offer – to compare health insurance plans based on costs, benefits, and other important features; to determine eligibility for health coverage and cost-sharing reductions; to choose a plan; and to enroll in coverage.

Also, this information is sometimes used to personalize the content we show to you on third-party sites.
Information which you may provide
When you request information:
We collect information including your email address or mobile phone number to deliver alerts or e-newsletters. We use this information to complete the subscription process and provide you with information. You can opt out of these communications at any time by editing your subscription preferences.
When you apply for health insurance coverage:
To establish an account on HealthCare.gov, we collect information like your first and last name, your email address, and your responses to three questions used for password recovery. We use this information to establish and maintain your account to login and utilize HealthCare.gov. We use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add security to your HealthCare.gov account and ensure you as the authorized user are the only person who can access it. If you agree to use MFA, we collect your phone number or your email address. We use this information to send a code by text message, email, or phone call. Visit granicus.com/wireless/healthcareExternal Link for more information on how this works. Then, when you begin the application process, we collect information from you that is used to verify your identity. The Health Insurance Marketplace® contracts with Experian and Symantec to verify the information you disclose as part of this identity proofing and authentication process.
On HealthCare.gov, we provide streamlined applications that allow you to apply for affordable health insurance coverage. When you apply using one of these forms, we collect personally identifiable information about you and are authorized to maintain a record of the information related to your application.
After you complete an application, some of your application information may be disclosed to other federal agencies so that your eligibility for affordable health insurance can be determined. These organizations may include the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Defense (DoD)/TRICARE, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), state Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) agencies, and Equifax Workforce Solutions, with which the Marketplace engages in an electronic verification process authorized by the Affordable Care Act. Some of your information may also be verified against data provided to the Marketplace by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Peace Corps if necessary to verify whether you are eligible for or enrolled in Minimal Essential Coverage (MEC). Your information may also be shared with the employer(s) listed on your application for the limited purposes of verifying whether you are eligible for or enrolled in employer-sponsored coverage or advance premium tax credits.
In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, a system of records has been created for the collection of personally identifiable information you submit to HealthCare.gov. The original system of records notice entitled, “Health Insurance Exchanges (HIX) Program” was published in the Federal Register on February 6, 2013. This notice was amended on May 29, 2013 and on October 23, 2013. The system of records and modifications can be found at: http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Computer-Data-and-Systems/Privacy/CMS-Systems-of-Records.html.
For specific details on the data collected by the systems that make up the Marketplace, go to the Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) located at: http://www.hhs.gov/pia/.

How the Health Insurance Marketplace® uses information it collects
When processing your application after you apply for health insurance coverage
We use the application information you choose to provide to determine eligibility for enrollment in a qualified health plan through the Marketplace, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), advance premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions, and certifications of exemption from the individual shared responsibility requirement. We also verify the information provided on the application, communicate with you or your authorized representative and provide the information to the health plan you select so that it can enroll you in a qualified health plan. If you submitted your Marketplace application through the website of an agent, broker or a health insurance company and not through HealthCare.gov, we will also communicate with the entity you applied or enrolled with regarding your application and supply them with your eligibility determination and other related information. You can find more information about how we use the information you provide on the application in the Privacy Act Statements at the following links:
Individuals and Families
Agents and Brokers
Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) for Employers
You can learn more about how we handle your information at https://www.healthcare.gov/how-we-use-your-data.
When sending you Marketplace messages
The Marketplace uses the email address (or mobile phone number) you provide us to send emails or Short Message Service (SMS) messages related to HealthCare.gov, if you have given us permission to send you such emails and text messages. The Marketplace also may use the phone number you provided to us (or was sent to us by your state) to call or SMS/text you about Marketplace coverage.
When calling about your application or account
The Marketplace uses the phone number you provided us to communicate important information about your application or account. Periodically, you may receive prerecorded phone calls from the Marketplace. If you want to stop receiving notifications in the form of prerecorded phone calls, contact the Marketplace Call Center at 1-800-318-2596 and ask to be added to our do not call list. TTY users can call 1-855-889-4325. After we update your account, a Marketplace representative may still call you if there is an issue with your account or health plan, including if:
A technical error occurred when you applied on HealthCare.gov — you probably got an error message when completing your application — that prevented:
	You from enrolling in a plan, or
Your health insurance company from receiving your enrollment information

The Marketplace needs more information to verify or add to information you entered on your application about your income, citizenship, immigration status, identity, or something else. We do this when some information you provided doesn’t match our records. (Note: This is sometimes called a "data matching issue" or "inconsistency," but both terms mean the same thing.) The Marketplace won’t end health insurance or change savings based on health insurance data matching issues without giving you advance notice. You'll get three warning notices and a reminder phone call before coverage ends or your savings change because of a data matching issue
Your health insurance company is no longer offering your plan through the Marketplace
When getting your health coverage application from state Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
When a state Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) transfers a health coverage application for you and your household members to the Marketplace, it may be due to ineligibility for Medicaid/CHIP coverage. However, you may be eligible for Marketplace coverage. The Marketplace processes the information we get to help you apply for and enroll in Marketplace coverage. The Marketplace may send you a letter and conduct outreach by phone, or send you email or SMS text messages based on the communication preferences included in your transferred application, if any. The communication is to let you know we've gotten your application and to help you transition to the Marketplace and find out what you may be eligible for.
In addition, the Marketplace may share your contact information from your transferred application with enrollment assistance contractors and Marketplace-certified grantees for the purposes of conducting outreach on behalf of the Marketplace and to help you with next steps in completing your Marketplace application and enrolling in coverage, if eligible. The Marketplace assisters may use your contact information to reach out to you and offer help with applying and enrolling in Marketplace coverage. You don't have to work with the Marketplace assister who may contact you. You can use HealthCare.gov, call the Marketplace Call Center, use Find Local Help to choose a different assister or find an agent/broker, or use a certified enrollment partner website to complete your Marketplace application and enroll in coverage. If you are contacted and want to confirm the person is certified and registered with the Marketplace, you can call the Marketplace Call Center for assistance at 1-800-318-2596. TTY users can call 1-855-889-4325.
When conducting surveys and improving services
The Marketplace also uses online surveys to collect opinions and feedback. You don’t have to answer these questions. If you do answer these questions, do not include any personally identifiable information in your answers. We analyze and use the information from these surveys to improve the site’s operation and content. The information is available only to Marketplace managers, members of the Marketplace communications and web teams, and other designated federal staff and contractors who require this information to perform their duties.
When using third-party tools for website analytics
The Marketplace uses a variety of third-party web analytics tools to collect basic information about visits to HealthCare.gov. This information is then used to maintain the website including: monitoring site stability, measuring site traffic, optimizing site content, and may help make the site more useful to visitors.
Marketplace staff analyzes the data collected from these tools. The reports are available only to Marketplace managers, teams who implement Federally Facilitated Marketplaces programs represented on HealthCare.gov, members of the Marketplace communications and web teams, and other designated federal staff and contractors who need this information to perform their duties.
When using third-party tools for outreach through digital advertising
The Marketplace uses third-party web services to conduct outreach and education through the use of digital advertising for the Marketplace. These third-party services may collect information through the use of web beacons that are located on our pages. A web beacon is a see-through graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a web page and, in combination with a cookie, allows us to collect information regarding the use of the web page that contains the web beacon.
We use web beacons to tell when a user is redirected to HealthCare.gov because of a Marketplace advertisement that we ran on another website was clicked on or otherwise interacted with (known as “click tracking” or “conversion tracking”) and to better target Marketplace advertisements (known as “retargeting”) to inform citizens about Marketplace deadlines and the benefits available through HealthCare.gov. Go to How the Health Insurance Marketplace® uses third-party websites and applications below for more information on how these tools work.
The Marketplace uses third-party tools to help deliver advertising. Vendors that operate the third-party tools may also gather information about your visits to third-party sites outside of HealthCare.gov. However, while the Marketplace doesn't track your individual-level activity on the Internet outside of HealthCare.gov, our vendors may collect information automatically collected by HealthCare.gov (not information you provide), and combine it with data they collect elsewhere for targeted advertising purposes. You can opt out of this type of data collection via Privacy Settings, Ad Choices, and Do Not Track. Go to Your Choices about tracking and data collection below for methods to opt out of this type of collection. The outreach and education analytics tools provide reports which aggregate data like the number of clicks on advertisements. The reports are available only to Marketplace managers, teams who implement the insurance affordability programs represented on HealthCare.gov, members of the HealthCare.gov communications and web teams, and other designated federal staff and contractors who need this information to perform their duties.

How the Health Insurance Marketplace® uses cookies and other technologies
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies, allows federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies to improve the delivery of services.
When you visit a website, its server may generate a piece of text known as a "cookie" to place on your device. The cookie, which is unique to your browser, allows the server to "remember" specific information about your visit while you are connected. The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of web pages. Information that you enter into the application isn't associated with cookies on HealthCare.gov. Depending on the third-party tool’s business practices, privacy policies, terms of service, and/or the privacy settings you selected, information you have provided to third parties could be used to identify you when you visit HealthCare.gov. These third parties don't/won't share your identity with CMS or Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
There are two types of cookies, single session (temporary), and multi-session (persistent). Single session cookies last only as long as your web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the session cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your device for longer periods. Both types of cookies create an ID that is unique to your device.
Session cookies: We use session cookies for technical purposes like to allow better navigation through our site. These cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to our site. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as "Usage Tier 1—Single Session.” The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of single session web measurement and customization technologies."
Persistent cookies: We use persistent cookies to understand the differences between new and returning visitors to HealthCare.gov. Persistent cookies remain on your device between visits to our site until they expire or are removed by the user. The OMB Memorandum 10-22 Guidance defines our use of persistent cookies as "Usage Tier 2—Multi-session without personally identifiable information.” The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of multi-session web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected." We don't use persistent cookies to collect personally identifiable information. CMS does not identify a user by using such technologies.
The Marketplace also uses the following technologies:
Persistent cookies for digital advertising: Similar to persistent cookies identified above, the Marketplace uses persistent cookies for outreach through digital advertising. These cookies can also be created on third-party sites and remain on your device between visits to our site until they expire or are removed by you. Consistent with OMB guidance for “Usage Tier 2”, we don't use persistent cookies for outreach to collect personally identifiable information. The Marketplace doesn't identify a user by using such technologies.
Web beacons for digital advertising: Also referred to as pixels and\or tracking tags – see-through images placed on certain pages of HealthCare.gov are typically used in conjunction with cookies and aren't stored on your device. When you access these pages, web beacons generate a notice of your visit. Go to the section How the Marketplace uses third-party websites and applications for information on how we use web beacons.
Website log files: Are used as an analysis tool and to tell how visitors use HealthCare.gov, how often they return, and how they navigate through the site.
Flash: Flash is used to assess the performance of the site and as a player for selected videos depending on the browser a device is using.
Local storage objects: We use Flash Local Storage Objects (“LSOs”) to store your preferences and to personalize your visit.

Your choices about tracking and data collection
The Health Insurance Marketplace® offers Privacy Settings which give you control over what tracking and data collection takes place during your visit. Third-party tools are enabled by default to provide a quality consumer experience.
The Privacy Settings provide you with the choice to opt-in or to opt-out of the different categories of third-party tools used by HealthCare.gov: Advertising, Analytics, or Social Media. The Privacy Settings prevent cookies, web beacons, and Local Storage Objects from being placed on your device. The Privacy Settings also prevent third-party tools from loading regardless of your cookie settings, which provides consumers with an additional layer of privacy that prevents the tool from loading at all. Because the Privacy Settings create a cookie in your browser, the opt-in and opt-out choices you make through the Privacy Settings will only be effective on the device and browser you used to make your choices, and your choices will expire when the cookie expires. Once the cookie is created, the Privacy Settings will retain your choices for 3 years from the date of your most recent visit. You may revisit the Privacy Settings to change or renew your choices at any time.
Modify Privacy Options
Note that if you disable cookies in your browser, Privacy Settings won't be able to store your preferences and won't function properly. If you don't wish to use our Privacy Settings to opt-out of the tools used by HealthCare.gov, you can opt-out of tools individually, or via the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) AdChoices icon, discussed in the next subsection.
Go to the list of third-party tools for more information on how to opt-out individually to each service.
If you opt out of the tools used by the Marketplace via the Privacy Settings or by opting out of the tools directly, you will still have access to information and resources at HealthCare.gov. Alternatively, if you don't want to use the website, you can use the call center to apply
AdChoices: The Marketplace includes the Ad Choices icon on all digital advertising that uses “conversion-tracking” or “re-targeting”. Go to How the Marketplace uses third-party websites and applications to learn about conversion tracking, targeted advertising, and retargeting. The AdChoices icon is usually at or near the corner of digital ads. When you click on the AdChoices icon it will provide information on what company served the ad and information on how to opt-out. For more information on AdChoices, visit the AdChoices websiteExternal Link.
Do Not Track: The Marketplace automatically observes the "Do Not Track" browser setting for digital advertising that uses "conversion-tracking" or "re-targeting". If "Do Not Track" is set before a device visits HealthCare.gov, third-party conversion tracking and retargeting tools won't load on the site. Go to How the Health Insurance Marketplace® uses third-party websites and applications to learn about conversion tracking and retargeting. For more information on Do Not Track or information on how to set the Do Not Track setting in your browser go to the Do Not Track websiteExternal Link.

How the Health Insurance Marketplace® uses third-party websites and applications
As a response to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo M-10-06, Open Government Directive, the HealthCare.gov site leverages a variety of technologies and social media services to communicate and interact with the public. These third-party websites and applications include popular social networking and media sites, open source software communities, and more.
Third-party websites
Your activity on the third-party websites that HealthCare.gov links to (like Facebook or Twitter) is governed by the security and privacy policies of those websites. You should review the privacy policies of all websites before using them so that you understand how your information may be used. You should also adjust privacy settings on your account on any third-party website to match your preferences.
Help On Demand
The Marketplace has contracted with Help On Demand (formerly known as BigWave Systems) to provide consumers access to Help On Demand, a service that connects consumers with Marketplace-registered and state-licensed insurance agents/brokers for assistance with obtaining eligibility determinations and enrollment in coverage. The service is a real-time referral system that allows consumers to request assistance from participating agents/ brokers in their area who can provide immediate assistance. Consumers who want assistance with completing an application on HealthCare.gov can navigate to the Help On Demand service by completing the online form or clicking on a hyperlink. If they choose to navigate to Help On Demand, they’re interacting with a website that is operated by a CMS contractor and a referral service that then provides their information directly to a Marketplace-registered insurance agent/ broker. Therefore, consumers using the service are subject to the security standards and privacy policies of the Help On Demand service. The Help On Demand website will display a detailed privacy notice as well as terms of use, which will govern users' activity on the website. Users should review this content before using Help On Demand to understand how their information may be used. For more information on this service, go to the CMS Privacy Impact Assessment for Help On Demand (PDF, 94 KB).
Enhanced Direct Enrollment
CMS, as operator of the Marketplace, manages and oversees an Enhanced Direct Enrollment (EDE) program that establishes agreements with qualified EDE partners, which include certain insurance companies and licensed agents and brokers that use their own websites to facilitate enrollment in Marketplace qualified health plans. These agreements authorize EDE partners to submit consumer application information collected directly from consumers to the Marketplace for an eligibility determination, without requiring consumers to submit Marketplace application information through HealthCare.gov. If you choose to apply for coverage through an EDE partner using its website, your activity on such a third-party website is governed by the security and privacy policies of the EDE partner and its website. Information needed to determine your eligibility status, your final eligibility determination, and other information related to your Marketplace application and enrollment will be shared between the EDE partner and CMS.
For more information on how your information is used and kept secure when you apply or enroll through an EDE partner without using HealthCare.gov, go to the CMS Privacy Impact Assessment for Enhanced Direct Enrollment Partner Websites.
Online appeals submission
The Marketplace has contracted with DocuSign Web Service, a service that provides consumers the ability to digitally sign and submit appeal request forms online to the Marketplace Appeals Center. Consumers that want to appeal a decision made by the Marketplace can submit their information into DocuSign, which is electronically sent to the Marketplace Appeals Center to be processed on. (Note: A copy of the appeal request is stored in DocuSign for 14 days before it is automatically deleted. This gives the Marketplace Appeals Center enough time to receive and process the request.) Consumers who want to submit their appeal request forms online can do so by selecting a hyperlink to a Marketplace Appeal Request Form website, operated by DocuSign, Inc. Once the consumer chooses to navigate to the DocuSign website, they are interacting with a third-party website that isn’t operated by the Marketplace, but provides their information directly to the Marketplace Appeals Center. Therefore, the consumer using the DocuSign service is subject to the security standards and privacy policies of the third-party website and DocuSign. The website will display a detailed privacy notice as well as terms of use which will govern users' activity on the website. Users should review this content before using the third-party website to understand how their information may be used. For more information on this service, go to the CMS Privacy Impact Assessment for DocuSign (PDF).
Website analytics tools
These tools collect basic site usage information such as: how many visits HealthCare.gov receives, the pages visited by consumers, time spent on the site, the number of return visits to the site, the approximate location of the device used to access the site, types of devices used, etc. This information is then used to maintain the website including: monitoring site stability, measuring site traffic, optimizing site content, and improving the consumer experience. Use the Marketplace Privacy Settings to opt-out of website analytics tools.
Digital advertising tools for outreach and education
The Marketplace uses third-party tools to support our digital advertising outreach and education efforts. These tools enable the Marketplace to reach new people and provide information to previous visitors. To use these tools, we use the following technologies on HealthCare.gov.
Click tracking: HealthCare.gov uses click tracking to identify the ads that are most helpful to consumers and efficient for outreach. This enables HealthCare.gov to improve the performance of ads that consumers click on. When users click on links from ads, data about what ad was viewed is collected. Reports are generated about ad performance – including the total number of views and clicks an ad received.
Conversion tracking: HealthCare.gov uses conversion tracking to identify ads that are helpful to consumers and efficient for outreach. It enables HealthCare.gov to improve the performance of ads viewed by consumers. When a HealthCare.gov ad is viewed on a third-party site (e.g. a banner ad), a cookie is placed in the browser of the device the ad was viewed on. If this device later visits HealthCare.gov, the visit is linked to the ad viewed on the same device. Use the Marketplace Privacy Settings to opt-out of advertising tools. Users can click on the “AdChoices” Icon in the corner of our Ads to opt-out of this Ad Targeting. Users who have set their browser to "Do Not Track" will automatically be opted out of conversion tracking. For more information about AdChoices and Do Not Track, go to "Your Choices about tracking and Data Collection."
Re-targeting: HealthCare.gov uses retargeting to provide information to consumers who have previously visited HealthCare.gov like reminders about upcoming enrollment deadlines. Retargeting enables the Marketplace to improve the performance of ads by delivering them to relevant audiences like recent visitors to HealthCare.gov. During a visit to HealthCare.gov, a cookie is placed in the browser of the devices used to view the site. When that same device is used to visit third-party sites that are displaying HealthCare.gov ads, ads for HealthCare.gov may be shown to that device because it had previously visited HealthCare.gov. Using these cookies, the Marketplace doesn't collect information about the third-party sites visited by a device. Reports are generated about ad performance – including the total number of views and clicks an ad received. Use the Marketplace Privacy Settings to opt-out of advertising tools. Users can click on the “AdChoices” Icon in the corner of our Ads to opt-out of this Ad Targeting. Users who have set their browser to “Do Not Track” will automatically be opt-ed out of conversion tracking. For more information about AdChoices and Do Not Track, go to Your Choices about Tracking and Data Collection.
Targeted advertising: The Marketplace uses third-party vendors to engage in targeted advertising (also known as online behavioral or interest-based advertising) to provide information to consumers across their online activities. Targeted advertising involves the collection of data from a particular computer or device. Data regarding web viewing behaviors or application use is gathered to predict user preferences or interests. The Marketplace can have ads delivered to computers or devices based on the preferences or interests inferred from the web viewing behaviors or application use.
Third-party vendors engaged by the Marketplace may also target advertising based on information automatically collected (not information you provide) when you browse the CMS websites or other websites on the internet. You can opt out this type of data collection via our Privacy Settings, Ad Choices, and Do Not Track. Go to Your Choices about Tracking and Data Collection above for methods to opt out of this type of collection.
The Marketplace may consider new third-party tools or the use of new third-party websites, but will first assess the tools or websites before it is used in connection with HealthCare.gov. The Marketplace will provide notice to the public before adding any new tool to HealthCare.gov. These assessments include a description about how information will be collected, accessed, secured, and stored. Get a list of the third-party tools currently being used on HealthCare.gov. Risk assessments for third-party websites and applications are available at http://www.hhs.gov/pia/.

How the Health Insurance Marketplace® protects your personal information
The Marketplace is committed to protecting consumer information entrusted with us. If you visit HealthCare.gov and choose to provide us with personally identifiable information through a request for information, paper or electronic form, application, questionnaire, survey, etc., we store your personally identifiable information in a record system designed to retrieve information about you by personal identifier (name, personal email address, home mailing address, personal or mobile phone number, etc.). We will safeguard the information you provide in accordance with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act and the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. Section 552a). CMS, the operator of HealthCare.gov, publishes System of Record Notices in the Federal Register for these record systems, and posts the System of Record Notices on CMS.gov.
The original system of records notice entitled, “Health Insurance Exchanges (HIX) Program” was published in the Federal Register on February 6, 2013. This notice was amended on May 29, 2013 and on October 23, 2013. The System of Records and modifications can be found at http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Computer-Data-and-Systems/Privacy/CMS-Systems-of-Records.html.
For further information about HealthCare.gov privacy policy, contact Privacy@cms.hhs.gov.
Third-party services are web-based technologies that are not exclusively operated or controlled by a government entity, or that involve significant participation of a nongovernment entity. These services may be separate websites or may be applications embedded within the Marketplace. The list of third-party services includes links to relevant third-party privacy policies.

How long the Health Insurance Marketplace® keeps data and how it is accessed
The Marketplace will keep data collected long enough to achieve the specified objective for which they were collected. Once the specified objective is achieved, the data will be retired or destroyed in accordance with published draft records schedules of CMS as approved by the National Archives and Records Administration.
The Marketplace doesn't store information from cookies on Marketplace systems. The persistent cookies used with third-party tools on HealthCare.gov can be stored on a user’s local system and are set to expire at varying time periods depending upon the cookie. The Marketplace assesses whether the expiration date of a cookie exceeds one year and provides an explanation as to why cookies with a longer life are used on the site in the associated Third-Party Website or Application Privacy Impact Assessment. These explanations can be found at http://www.hhs.gov/pia#Third-Party.

Children and privacy
We believe in the importance of protecting the privacy of children online. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) governs information gathered online from or about children under the age of 13. The HealthCare.gov site isn't intended to solicit information of any kind from children under age 13. If you believe that we have received information from a child under age 13, contact us at 1-800-318-2596 (TTY: 1-855-889-4325).

When you follow a link to an external site, you're leaving HealthCare.gov and are subject to the external site’s privacy and security policies. Non-federal websites might not operate under the same laws, regulations, and policies as federal websites. Aside from third-party websites listed in this privacy notice, the Health Insurance Marketplace® isn't responsible for the contents of external web pages and a link to a page doesn't constitute an endorsement.

What Is Human Trafficking?
Human trafficking occurs when a trafficker uses force, fraud or coercion to control another person for the purpose of engaging in commercial sex acts or soliciting labor or services against his/her will. Force, fraud, or coercion need not be present if the individual engaging in commercial sex is under 18 years of age.

Internship Indefinite Program (IIP)



Interns in this program are appointed to non-temporary, excepted service appointments, expected to last the length of the academic program for which the intern is enrolled. IIP participants, while in the program, are eligible for noncompetitive promotions if they meet the developed qualification standards for the position. IIP interns are also eligible for federal employee benefits (e.g. life, health, and retirement). IIP participants are eligible for noncompetitive conversions to the competitive service within 120 days of program completion.



Internship Temporary Program (ITP)



The temporary nature of the ITP allows for interns to work during seasonal and holiday breaks in academic programs as well as year-round. Interns in this program are appointed to temporary appointments, not to exceed one year or their projected graduation date (whichever is shorter) and extensions may be made in one year increments. The positions to which the interns are appointed have no promotion potential, therefore, students must apply through USAJOBS to be considered for higher-graded positions. ITP participants who are expected to work 130 hours per month or more for at least 90 days will be eligible to enroll in a health benefits plan. ITP participants are not eligible for any other benefits until after conversion into the competitive service. ITP participants are eligible for noncompetitive conversions to the competitive service within 120 days of completion of the Pathways Program.



How to Apply



Once an announcement is posted on www.usajobs.gov, complete applications (to include all required documents) must be submitted electronically.

This includes submitting the online application as well as any required documents as defined in the Required Documents section in the listed announcement. Candidates are encouraged to complete their applications the day the announcement opens to ensure they receive consideration. Should candidates be missing any of the required documents or submit their application late, they will be disqualified for consideration of employment.
Due to the volume of applications for the HHS’s Pathways programs, there is typically a maximum number of applications for each vacancy announcement. The vacancy will close on the closing date listed in the announcement or on midnight the day that the maximum number of applications are received. The vacancy will close when the first of these conditions are met. If the application limit is reached on the same day the announcement opened, the open and close date will be the same.

The following documents must be submitted for your application package to be considered complete.

Transcripts MUST include the student’s name, name of the school, current GPA/academic standing, past and current coursework, and degree program. If your school’s transcripts or documentation do not provide all the necessary information listed above, you should include additional official academic documentation that meets the requirements.

	For 5-point veteran’s preference, you must provide a copy of your DD-214 Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (Member Copy 4 is preferable) which must show the type of discharge and dates of active duty. If you are currently on active duty, you must provide a certification on letterhead from your military branch which contains your military service date, expected date of discharge or release, and the character of service to show that your military service was performed under honorable conditions. The expected date of discharge or release must be within 120 days of the date the certification is submitted for consideration for this vacancy announcement.

HHS Launches Innovation Challenge to Prevent Human Trafficking Among Women and Girls




The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) Office on Women’s Health (OWH), is launching a new challenge worth up to $1.8 million to organizations with successful innovative and life-changing approaches to address human trafficking prevention among women and girls in the United States. The challenge was announced today at the HHS National Human Trafficking Prevention Summit.
The National Human Trafficking Hotline estimates that 26.7 million people were impacted globally by human trafficking in 2021. Human trafficking is a crime that exploits a person for compelled labor, services, or commercial sex acts.
The national competition will award programs that demonstrate effectiveness in preventing human trafficking and/or improving health outcomes related to human trafficking among women and girls, sustainable program practices, and the ability of the program to be expanded and/or replicated.
“Human trafficking disproportionately impacts some of the most vulnerable and underserved members of our society,” said ADM Rachel L. Levine, HHS Assistant Secretary for Health. “This challenge is one example of a multi-pronged national effort to prevent and end this abhorrent practice that destroys lives.”
The challenge was created in alignment with the priorities highlighted in the White House National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking - PDF and the National Plan to End Gender-Based Violence - PDF. It also supports the goals of the HHS Task Force to Prevent Human Trafficking.
While anyone can be a victim of human trafficking, Black, Latino, American Indian, Alaska Natives, Asians, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, LGBTQI+ individuals, people with disabilities and individuals with low income are among the populations that are most vulnerable to human trafficking. Migration or relocation, substance use, unstable housing, abuse, childhood trauma, and mental health issues can also increase the risk. Human trafficking can cause toxic stress that wears down immunity, contributing to risk of liver disease, chronic renal disease, and other autoimmune and neurological disorders. 
“Women and girls’ safety, health and wellbeing are significantly impacted by trafficking,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Women’s Health Dr. Dorothy Fink. “OWH is pleased to begin identifying and awarding programs that demonstrate effectiveness in preventing human trafficking and/or improving health outcomes related to trafficking among women and girls.”
The challenge has two phases. Phase 1 will award twenty $50,000 prizes to existing, innovative programs that have demonstrated outcomes in successfully preventing human trafficking and/or improving health outcomes related to human trafficking among women and girls.  Phase 2 will offer eight awards up to $100,000 that will go to the programs in Phase 1 that have successfully expanded and/or replicated to increase the impact of their program in preventing human trafficking and/or improving health outcomes related to human trafficking on women and girls.
The HHS Office for the Administration of Children and Families (ACF) Office of Trafficking in Persons (OTIP) provided expertise to create this challenge. For additional public resources, contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888, TTY: 711, Text* 233733. SOAR Online also provides resources for healthcare professionals.

HHS Announces the Formation of the Office of Long COVID Research and Practice and Launch of Long COVID Clinical Trials Through the RECOVER Initiative




Current analysis estimates that 7.7 million to 23 million Americans have developed Long COVID.
Today, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra released the following statement applauding the formation of the Office of Long COVID Research and Practice to lead the Long COVID response and coordination across the federal government and, in addition, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launch of the Long COVID clinical trials through the RECOVER Initiative.
“As our nation continues to make strides in combating COVID-19, it is crucial that we address the impact of Long COVID and provide resources to those in need,” said HHS Secretary Becerra. “Last year President Biden called on HHS to coordinate the response to Long COVID. The Official establishment of the Long COVID Coordinating office and the launch of the RECOVER clinical trials solidifies this issue as an ongoing priority.”
“The Office of Long COVID Research and Practice will enhance efforts being undertaken across the U.S. government to improve the lives of those who continue to experience the long-term impacts of the worst public health crisis in a century,” said Adm Rachel Levine, M.D. “Bringing together the resources and expertise of federal, state, and local partners, patients, providers, researchers, and the business sector to answer the American peoples most urgent calls to action.”
Background on the Office of Long COVID Research and Practice: 
The Office of Long COVID Research will be located within HHS’s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health under the leadership of the HHS Assistant Secretary for Health, Admiral Rachel Levine. The Office is charged with on-going coordination of the whole-of-government response to the longer-term effects of COVID-19, including Long COVID and associated conditions and the implementation of the National Research Action Plan on Long COVID and the Services and Supports for Longer-Term Impacts of COVID-19. Currently 14 federal departments engage on Long COVID, including over a dozen HHS Operating and Staff Divisions with a goal to reduce the impacts of Long COVID by improving quality of life for people living with Long COVID and reducing disparities related to Long COVID. 
Background on the RECOVER Initiative:
The NIH RECOVER Initiative is a $1.15 billion nationwide research program designed to understand, treat, and prevent long COVID, which describes long-term symptoms following infection by SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. More than 200 symptoms are associated with long COVID, and the condition can cause problems throughout the body, affecting nearly all body systems including the nervous, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, autonomic, and immune systems.
Launched in 2021, RECOVER established one of the largest, most diverse study group of patients with Long COVID in the world. The initial stage of the initiative involved launching large observational multi-site studies examining and following people through their experience with COVID-19 to learn why some people develop long-term symptoms while others recover completely. These studies are ongoing and have recruited more than 24,000 participants to date. Researchers also are analyzing 60 million electronic health records and conducting more than 40 pathobiology studies on how COVID-19 affects different body tissues and organs.  This study cohort participated in RECOVER observational studies that allowed researchers to characterize the condition in great detail, which is critical for informing the development of clinical trials to test interventions. The clinical trials are designed so multiple treatments and therapies can be studied across five focus areas. Platform protocols for two of these areas were posted today, July 31, with enrollment for these trials beginning the end of July and throughout the summer. To learn more about the RECOVER clinical trials visit: https://trials.RECOVERCovid.org.
Through collaboration with federal partners, researchers, clinicians, patient advocacy organizations, and the business sector, the Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to addressing the longer-term impacts of the worst public health crisis in a century. We will continue to listen and learn from patients, caregivers, frontline workers, and those with lived experience, so we can accelerate understanding and breakthroughs together.

HHS Awards $2.5 Million to Help Decrease Food Insecurity in Native Communities




The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the Indian Health Service, awards $2.5 million in funding to support the development of produce prescription programs in tribal communities. The purpose of the IHS Produce Prescription Pilot Program is to help reduce food insecurity and improve health care outcomes among American Indian and Alaska Native people by increasing access to produce and other traditional foods within Native communities.
“Food is medicine and nutrition is health. It is critical that all Americans have access to healthy food,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “Programs like this feed directly into our Administration’s goal of building healthier communities at the local level. This announcement will help to make it easier for American Indian and Alaska Native communities to enjoy healthy eating and good nutrition.”
"This funding is not just an allocation of resources, but a resounding commitment to addressing food insecurity in American Indian and Alaska Native communities,” said IHS Director Roselyn Tso. “It is a recognition of the urgent need to empower and support tribal communities in their pursuit of food sovereignty and well-being."
Produce prescription programs have been shown to increase access to nutritious foods in communities at risk for food insecurity. These programs help meet the needs of individuals and families experiencing food insecurity and diet related health problems by obtaining fruits and vegetables more easily. The IHS Produce Prescription Pilot Program is another action being taken to implement the Biden-Harris Administration’s National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health to end hunger and increase healthy eating and physical activity by 2030 so fewer Americans experience diet-related diseases.
The goal of this program is to demonstrate and evaluate the impact of produce prescription programs on American Indian and Alaska Native people and their families, specifically by reducing food insecurity, improving overall dietary health by increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and traditional food consumption, and improving health care outcomes.
The following tribes and tribal organizations received $500,000 each in 2023 grant funding to implement a produce prescription program in their communities:

Laguna Healthcare Corporation
Paraje
New Mexico
Muscogee (Creek) Nation
Okmulgee
Oklahoma
Navajo Health Foundation - Sage Memorial Hospital
Ganado
Arizona
Pascua Yaqui Tribe
Tucson
Arizona
Rocky Boy Health Center
Box Elder
Montana
American Indian and Alaska Native people are disproportionately impacted by food insecurity when compared to non-Native people and are more likely to live in areas with low or no access to fresh foods than any other racial or ethnic group. About one in four Native people experience food insecurity, compared to one in nine Americans overall. The higher rates of food insecurity among American Indian and Alaska Native people are exacerbated by water insecurity, loss of land, forced relocation, and environmental pollution, all of which have negatively impacted traditional healthy food practices.
The IHS Division of Diabetes Treatment and Prevention provides programmatic leadership to the Produce Prescription Pilot Program, as well as extensive training and resources, which are widely used by program sites and clinicians across the country.
The IHS, an agency in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, provides a comprehensive health service delivery system for approximately 2.8 million American Indians and Alaska Natives who belong to 574 federally recognized tribes in 37 states.

Biden-Harris Administration Announces Medicare Dementia Care Model




New Model Enhances Care Coordination and Increases Support for Caregivers
The Biden-Harris Administration is taking further action on its commitment to promote care and support for people with Medicare living with dementia and their unpaid caregivers. Today, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), announced its Guiding an Improved Dementia Experience (GUIDE) Model, which aims to improve the quality of life for people living with dementia, reduce strain on unpaid caregivers, and help people remain in their homes and communities through a package of care coordination and management, caregiver education and support, and respite services. The GUIDE Model will be tested by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation and is a key deliverable from President Biden’s April 2023 Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers, as well as key goals of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease (National Plan).
“HHS continues to innovate to help Americans living with dementia and their unpaid caregivers. Our new GUIDE Model has the potential to improve the quality of life for people with dementia and alleviate the significant strain on our families,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “We are proud to take these steps to deliver on the President’s promise to increase care coordination and improve access to services and supports for our families.”
“While we have made tremendous progress in improving care for people with dementia through the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease, people living with dementia and their caregivers too often struggle to manage their health care and connect with key supports that can allow them to remain in their homes and communities. Fragmented care contributes to the mental and physical health strain of caring for someone with dementia, as well as the substantial financial burden,” said CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. “We know that Black, Hispanic, and Asian Americans, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander populations have been particularly disadvantaged in receiving dementia care. The GUIDE Model will provide new resources and greater access to specialty dementia care in underserved populations and communities.”
Through the GUIDE Model, CMS will test an alternative payment for participants who deliver key supportive services to people with dementia, including comprehensive, person-centered assessments and care plans, care coordination, and 24/7 access to a support line. Under the model, people with dementia and their caregivers will have access to a care navigator who will help them access services and supports, including clinical services and non-clinical services such as meals and transportation through community-based organizations.
The model is also designed to enhance access to the assistance and resources caregivers need, a key priority of the Biden-Harris Administration and Goal 3 of the National Plan: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias and Their Families. Evidence-based models of support for caregivers of people with dementia and dementia-capable community-based providers have been expanded over the last decade through investments in research and services by HHS and others. The model will provide a link between the clinical health care system and community-based providers to help people with dementia and their caregivers access education and support, such as training programs on best practices for caring for a loved one living with dementia. Model participants will also help caregivers access respite services, which enable them to take temporary breaks from their caregiving responsibilities. Respite has been found to help caregivers continue to care for their loved ones at home, preventing or delaying the need for facility care.
“As millions of Americans already know, dementia can devastate people and their families in many ways. The GUIDE Model aims to mitigate the significant challenges of coordinating and managing health care and community-based supports and improve quality of life for patients and caregivers alike,” said CMS Deputy Administrator and Innovation Center Director Liz Fowler. “By offering caregiver support, respite services, and improved access to community-based supports, the GUIDE Model aims to keep people living with dementia safer and in their homes longer.”
The GUIDE Model also supports the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal of advancing health equity for underserved communities. Black and Hispanic, and Asian Americans, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander populations have a higher prevalence of dementia, are less likely to receive a diagnosis, and have more unmet needs. These populations are also more likely to experience high caregiving demands and spend more of their family assets on dementia care. By providing financial and technical assistance for developing new dementia care programs targeted to underserved areas, this model aims to improve the health outcomes and caregiving experience of Black, Hispanic, and Asian Americans, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander individuals and their families through increased access to specialty dementia care.
CMS will release the application for GUIDE, a voluntary, nationwide model, in Fall 2023. Prior to the application release, interested organizations are encouraged to submit Letters of Intent to CMS by September 15, 2023. The model will run for eight years beginning July 1, 2024.
For additional information, CMS has developed a GUIDE Model Fact Sheet or visit the GUIDE Model webpage.

            HHS Response to the Mpox Outbreak
          




























































HHS Response to the Mpox Outbreak





Mpox is a virus spread mostly through close, intimate contact with someone who has already contracted the virus. Currently, HHS – through the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention – is tracking an outbreak of mpox that has spread across several countries that don’t normally report mpox, including the United States.
As part of the whole-of-government approach to tackling mpox, HHS is working closely with public health officials and other key stakeholders to ensure high-risk communities in localities across the country get vaccines, testing, and treatments.


White House National Mpox Response Deputy Coordinator, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, answers some questions on mpox vaccines, including the intradermal route for the JYNNEOS vaccine. Prior to being appointed as Deputy Coordinator, Dr. Daskalakis served as Director of the CDC Division of HIV Prevention and is a national expert on health issues affecting the LGBTQI+ community.

NOTE: On November 28, 2022, The World Health Organization announced the name “mpox” is to replace what was previously referred to as “monkeypox.” This site has been updated to reflect this change, while some material created prior to the change may still reflect the old name.

Information for Families During the Formula Shortage 






Read this page in:

There’s nothing as important to families as the health and safety of their babies, and the formula shortage has left many people feeling anxious about how they’ll feed them. Some young children, teens, and adults with medical needs also rely on formula for their nutrition. They may be impacted by the shortage, too.
We know it’s not easy to change your baby’s diet. However, if you can’t find formula in stock, here are some tips for finding safe substitutes.
Find Safe Substitutes
Information provided reflects input from physicians and other experts at the Department of Health and Human Services, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the North American Society For Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition (NASPGHAN).

Try a New Brand of Formula


One-Page Flier

English
Spanish


Note: Children younger than 6 months old should only drink breast milk or infant formula. Talk with your pediatrcian or other health care provider if you are having difficulty breastfeeding or finding infant formula.
Most babies will do just fine with different brands of formula, including store brands, as long as they're the same type, like cow's milk-based, soy, hypoallergenic (extensively hydrolyzed), or elemental (amino acid-based). Keep in mind that your baby may seem to not like the taste, or may have a hard time tolerating a different formula, initially. If this happens:
Try slowly introducing small amounts of the new formula by mixing it with your regular formula. Slowly increase the amount of the new formula over time.
Be patient, since it may take some time for your baby to get used to it.
If your baby is vomiting, has gas pains, is crying or can't be calmed down during feedings, is losing weight, has diarrhea, has blood or mucus in their poop, or is straining to poop, they may not be tolerating the new formula. Call your pediatrician or other health care provider if you have questions.
If you need help figuring out which formulas you may be able to substitute:
Your pediatrician or other health care provider is always the best resource because they know your baby and their health history.
You can also check this list of comparable formulas developed by an organization of pediatric gastroenterologists called NASPGHAN. Keep in mind that this list focuses on substitutes for formulas that were part of the February 2022 recall, so you might not see your baby's formula listed here. Any substitution should only be done under the recommendation and supervision of your pediatrician or other healthcare provider.
Learn more about formula preparation and storage.


Image
 

Try Formula That’s Made in Another Country

You can also consider buying formula that's made outside of the United States in U.S. stores. Stores will start carrying or may already have these options. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed these formula companies to market certain products in the United States, and may allow more infant formula products that meet its criteria to be sold in the U.S. When preparing formula made in other countries:
Read the mixing instructions carefully for preparing powdered formulas. They may require different amounts of powder or water than formulas made in the U.S.
Use the FDA's conversion chart to convert milliliters to fluid ounces and common conversions from Celsius (°C) to Fahrenheit (°F).
Consumers should be cautious when buying formula that’s made outside of the U.S. from online marketplaces, as it has the potential to be counterfeit. Learn more about how to spot counterfeit infant formula: What are counterfeit infant formulas? How can I avoid buying such products?


Image
 

Talk to Your Pediatrician or Other Health Care Provider About Substitutes for Hypoallergenic or Specialty Formula.

If you need hypoallergenic or medical specialty formula, it may be harder to find a substitute. Talk to your pediatrician or other health care provider about acceptable substitutes. Depending on which formula your baby needs, your doctor may be able to submit an urgent request for specialized formula to Abbott Nutrition, which is releasing some specialty and low-iron formulas on a case-by-case basis.
Feed Your Baby Safely
If you can't find enough formula, there may be some short-term options that can help in an urgent situation. You should also know about serious safety concerns related to certain alternative preparations for feeding your baby. Always talk to your pediatrician or other health care provider first if you don't have enough formula to feed your baby.


Image
 

Talk to Your Pediatrician or Other Health Care Provider About Short-Term Options









If you can’t find any formula and your baby is older than 6 months, talk to your pediatrician or other health care provider about using whole cow’s milk as a short-term option.





Whole cow's milk is not recommended for babies under one year old. Cow's milk doesn't have the right amount of nutrients your baby needs and has too many proteins and minerals for your baby's kidneys to handle.
However, you may be able to give your baby some pasteurized (not raw), unflavored, whole cow's milk if:
	Your baby is older than 6 months
Your baby drinks regular formula, not a specialty product for allergies or other special health needs
You can't find formula.
Your baby is able to take some solid foods such as iron fortified infant cereals

Don't give your baby cow's milk for more than one week, or as instructed by your pediatrician or other health care provider. Since cow's milk does not contain as much iron as formula does, it's important to start introducing plenty of iron-rich complimentary foods at six months of age, like iron-fortified cereals.
Talk to your pediatrician or other health care provider if you're thinking about giving your baby cow's milk.






If you can’t find any formula and your baby is close to one year old, talk to your pediatrician or other health care provider about using soy milk as a short-term solution. Avoid other plant-based milks, like oat or almond milk.





Plant-based milks are generally not recommended for babies under one year old. However, if you can't find formula and your baby is close to one year old and can't tolerate cow's milk, soy milk may be an option. Talk to your pediatrician or other health care provider if you're thinking about giving your baby soy milk.
Don't give your baby soy milk for more than one week, or as instructed by your pediatrician or other healthcare provider. If you have to use soy milk, buy the kind that's fortified with calcium and vitamin D. Switch back to formula as soon as you can.
Avoid almond milk or other plant milks. These are often low in protein and minerals.






If you can’t find any formula and your baby is close to one year old, talk to your pediatrician or other health care provider about using a toddler drink for a few days.





Toddler drinks, often found in the formula aisles, are not recommended for babies under a year of age.
However, if you have no other choice, these products can be safe for a few days for babies who are close to one year old.
Talk to your pediatrician or other health care provider if you're considering using toddler drinks.










Image
 

Explore Resources for Breast Milk or Breastfeeding

Talk with your pediatrician or other health care provider about using human milk from a human milk bank.
If possible, consider a local milk bank that is accredited through the Human Milk Banking Association of North America (HMBANA). Keep in mind that most of the milk from milk banks is given to hospitalized babies, and they may not have enough to serve healthy babies at all times.
Never purchase human milk on the internet. Human milk bought through the internet could be diluted with other substances or contaminated with germs and might not be collected, stored, or transported safely. You also cannot be sure if the donor was medically screened for infectious diseases or drug use.
Informal human milk sharing in the community also has risks. If you are considering feeding your baby with human milk from a source other than the baby’s mother, talk to your pediatrician or other healthcare provider about the potential risks.
For families who are using both breast milk and formula, consider shifting more of your baby’s diet to breast milk.
This could mean you need to increase your breast milk supply. You can do this by breastfeeding your baby more frequently or by adding pumping sessions between breastfeedings. Pumped milk can be kept in a refrigerator and stored frozen for later use.
The CDC provides more information about breastfeeding, travel, and pumping and local support for mothers who are breastfeeding.


Image
 

Avoid Unsafe Formula Practices and Buying More Than You Need

Don't try to make formula at home. There are serious health and safety concerns with homemade formula. Your baby's nutritional needs are very specific, especially in the first year of life. Homemade formula may contain too little or too much of certain vitamins and minerals, like iron. Homemade formula also increases the risk of contamination, which could make your baby sick or lead to infection.
Don't water down formula. Adding more water means your baby does not get enough of the nutrients they need and can lead to serious health problems, like seizures.
Don't use formula past the "best by" or "use by" date. The formula may not be safe and may have lost some of its nutrients.
Don't buy more formula than you need. The shortage is affecting families who are already navigating the stress of parenting during a pandemic. It can be tempting to buy as much formula as possible right now, but the AAP suggests buying no more than a 10-14 day supply to help improve shortages.

Get Help From WIC
If you need help buying formula, you’re not alone. About 43 percent of all babies in the U.S. receive help from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). WIC provides formula and food for your family, and can connect you to trained professionals who provide health screenings, breastfeeding support, and nutrition advice. You can also participate in WIC while you’re pregnant. Contact your local WIC clinic to see if you or your family is eligible.

Get Help Finding Formula
Organizations in your community and formula companies may be able to help you find formula or safe substitutes.

Community Resources

Locate your nearest Community Action Agency (CAA): Your local CAA may be able to give you formula or connect you with local agencies that have formula.
Call 211: United Way’s 2-1-1 can connect you to a community resource specialist who may be able to help you find local food pantries and other sources of formula.

Formula Company Phone Numbers

Formula companies may be able to help you find formula or safe substitutes. Because a lot of people are looking for formula, you may experience long wait times. Most types of formula may also be out of stock.
MyGerber Baby Expert: Reach a certified nutrition or lactation consultant by phone, text, Facebook Messenger, web chat, or video call to help you find a similar formula that may be more readily available.
Similac (Abbott’s) urgent product request line: Ask your gynecologist (OB/GYN) or your baby’s pediatrician or other health care provider to submit an urgent product request for metabolic or low-iron formula by downloading and completing the form.
Enfamil (Reckitt’s) customer service line: Call 1-800-222-9123 (BABY-123) for help finding formula.
Learn About How the Shortage Started
Supply chain issues from the pandemic contributed to the current formula shortage. It worsened when Abbott Nutrition, one of the country’s largest formula producers, voluntarily recalled formula and closed one of its production facilities in Sturgis, Michigan. The President, agencies across the U.S. government, retailers, and the formula industry are working around the clock to address this shortage and get formula back on shelves. To date, production has ramped up 30-50%.
Learn About Actions the U.S. Government is Taking
The President invoked the Defense Production Act. This law puts U.S. formula manufacturers first in line to receive the resources they need to increase formula production. The President is also working with other countries to airlift formula to the U.S. through Operation Fly Formula.
The FDA and the U.S. Department of Justice negotiated a consent decree with Abbott Nutrition, under which Abbott Nutrition agreed to take specified corrective actions in order to start producing formula again at their Michigan facility. Abbott Nutrition has stated that it will focus on specialty formulas for people with metabolic and other needs first. FDA has also been meeting regularly with other major formula manufacturers who are working to produce more formula to meet the demand. Read more about FDA’s actions.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is working with states, tribal nations, and territories across the country to ensure that families who participate in WIC can use their benefits to purchase additional types of formula.
Read more about the additional steps that President Biden is taking to address the formula shortage.

Coronavirus (COVID-19)


 


HHS and our federal partners are working together with state, local, tribal and territorial governments, public health officials, health care providers, researchers, private sector organizations and the public to execute a whole-of-America response to the COVID-19 pandemic that protects the health and safety of the American people and moves the country forward safely.
The President’s National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan focuses on four key goals:
Protect against and treat COVID-19
Prepare for new variants
Prevent economic and educational shutdowns
Continue to lead the effort to vaccinate the world and save lives
Our Tools
America must maintain the tools – vaccines, boosters, treatments, tests, and masks – to protect against COVID-19 and dramatically decrease the risk of the most severe outcomes.












            Vaccines & Boosters
           



Vaccines are the best tool we have to prevent hospitalization and death.










            Treatments & Therapeutics
           



We have a diverse medicine cabinet filled with more treatments now than at any point in the pandemic.















            Tests
           



We have free testing sites at locations across the country.










            Masks
           



Free N95 masks are available, and these critical tools can help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Together We Can Save Lives
We can prevent overdoses and save lives by ensuring equitable access to essential health care and support services without stigma.
Learn How




 





Primary Prevention 
Preventing substance use disorder is the first step towards addressing overdoses. Learn about effective prevention programs and safe prescribing practices.
/overdose-prevention/primary-prevention






Harm Reduction 
Harm reduction is critical to keeping people who use drugs alive and as healthy as possible. Read the research and reduce stigma.
/overdose-prevention/harm-reduction








Evidence-Based Treatment 
When a person is ready, high-quality treatment must be available without delay. Help improve access to treatment.
/overdose-prevention/treatment






Recovery Support 
Recovery support services can lead to better long-term outcomes, especially when available in communities where they are needed. Explore different types of recovery services.
/overdose-prevention/recovery-support










The overdose crisis is national, but the impact is personal.
As the overdose crisis continues to change, we must take a pragmatic, evidence-based approach to saving lives, reducing risk, and removing barriers to effective interventions. This requires that we provide care and services that respect the health and dignity of people who use drugs.
 

Trends in U.S. Drug Overdose Deaths (1999 - 2021)
The overdose crisis has evolved over time and is now largely characterized by deaths involving illicitly manufactured synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, and, increasingly, stimulants.

Synthetic opioids excluding methadone overdose deaths increased 97-fold
Psychostimulants with abuse potential (primarily methamphetamine) overdose deaths increased 59-fold
Cocaine overdose increased 6.4-fold
Rx opioid overdose deaths increased 4.9-fold


This graph shows the total number of drug overdose deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2021 (the 2021 are provisional).The data shows that overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids excluding methadone have increased 97-fold.  Overdose deaths involving psychostimulants (primarily methamphetamine) with abuse potential have increased 59-fold.,. Overdose deaths involving cocaine have increased 6.4-fold. And overdose deaths involving prescription opioids have increased 4.9 -fold. Source: National Vital Statistics System Mortality File

Instability Increases Overdose
People without health insurance, or who were incarcerated, or who are living in poverty are at increased risk of fatal opioid overdose.

Working Together to Combat the Overdose Crisis
Canada and the U.S. have published a white paper, Substance Use and Harms During COVID-19 and Approaches to Federal Surveillance and Response, that examines rapid and innovative approaches used by both countries to monitor substance use trends during the pandemic, including:
substance use harms and deaths in Canada and the U.S.
the impact of COVID-19 on the opioids crisis
policy responses to address substance use from the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic to September 2022

Further Resources on Poverty Measurement, Poverty Lines, and Their History

ASPE research on poverty
The Census Bureau's Poverty Home Page
The separate poverty guidelines for Alaska and Hawaii reflect Office of Economic Opportunity administrative practice beginning in the 1966-1970 period. Note that the poverty thresholds — the original version of the poverty measure — have never had separate figures for Alaska and Hawaii. The poverty guidelines are not defined for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau. In cases in which a Federal program using the poverty guidelines serves any of those jurisdictions, the Federal office which administers the program is responsible for deciding whether to use the contiguous-states-and-D.C. guidelines for those jurisdictions or to follow some other procedure.
The poverty guidelines apply to both aged and non-aged units. The guidelines have never had an aged/non-aged distinction; only the Census Bureau (statistical) poverty thresholds have separate figures for aged and non-aged one-person and two-person units.
Programs using the guidelines (or percentage multiples of the guidelines — for instance, 125 percent or 185 percent of the guidelines) in determining eligibility include Head Start, the Supplemental Nutition Assistance Program (SNAP), the National School Lunch Program, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Note that in general, cash public assistance programs (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Supplemental Security Income) do NOT use the poverty guidelines in determining eligibility. The Earned Income Tax Credit program also does NOT use the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility. For a more detailed list of programs that do and don’t use the guidelines, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).
The poverty guidelines (unlike the poverty thresholds) are designated by the year in which they are issued. For instance, the guidelines issued in January 2023 are designated the 2023 poverty guidelines. However, the 2023 HHS poverty guidelines only reflect price changes through calendar year 2022; accordingly, they are approximately equal to the Census Bureau poverty thresholds for calendar year 2022. (The 2022 thresholds are expected to be issued in final form in September 2023; a preliminary version of the 2022 thresholds is now available from the Census Bureau.)
The poverty guidelines may be formally referenced as “the poverty guidelines updated periodically in the Federal Register by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2).”
There are two slightly different versions of the federal poverty measure: poverty thresholds and poverty guidelines.
The poverty thresholds are the original version of the federal poverty measure. They are updated each year by the Census Bureau. The thresholds are used mainly for statistical purposes — for instance, preparing estimates of the number of Americans in poverty each year. (In other words, all official poverty population figures are calculated using the poverty thresholds, not the guidelines). Poverty thresholds since 1973 (and for selected earlier years) and weighted average poverty thresholds since 1959 are available on the Census Bureau’s Web site. For an example of how the Census Bureau applies the thresholds to a family’s income to determine its poverty status, see “How the Census Bureau Measures Poverty” on the Census Bureau’s web site.
The poverty guidelines are the other version of the federal poverty measure. They are issued each year in the Federal Register by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The guidelines are a simplification of the poverty thresholds for use for administrative purposes — for instance, determining financial eligibility for certain federal programs.
The poverty guidelines are sometimes loosely referred to as the “federal poverty level” (FPL), but that phrase is ambiguous and should be avoided, especially in situations (e.g., legislative or administrative) where precision is important.
Key differences between poverty thresholds and poverty guidelines are outlined in a table under Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). See also the discussion of this topic on the Institute for Research on Poverty’s web site.
The January 2023 poverty guidelines are calculated by taking the 2021 Census Bureau’s poverty thresholds and adjusting them for price changes between 2021 and 2022 using the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). The poverty thresholds used by the Census Bureau for statistical purposes are complex and are not composed of standardized increments between family sizes. Since many program officials prefer to use guidelines with uniform increments across family sizes, the poverty guidelines include rounding and standardizing adjustments.

Current as of:
June 16, 2023



The Children's Bureau supports programs, research, and monitoring to help eliminate barriers to adoption and find permanent families for children. CB provides funding to states and tribes to help them support families who adopt from foster care. We provide additional funds to states that achieve a high number of adoptions of children from foster care.
Our programs include:
Title IV-E Adoption Assistance
Adoption Opportunities
Infant Adoption Awareness Training
Adoption and Legal Guardianship Incentives
The Adoption and Legal Guardianship Incentive Payments program (formerly called the Adoption Incentive Payments program) recognizes improved performance in helping children and youth in foster care find permanent homes through adoption and legal guardianship. The program was originally established as part of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 and has been reauthorized and revised several times since. In the 2014 reauthorization, the program was renamed to reflect that incentives will be paid to jurisdictions for improved performance in both adoptions and legal guardianship of children in foster care. The program was most recently reauthorized through fiscal year 2021 as part of the Family First Prevention Services Act, signed into law in February 2018.
Adoption and Legal Guardianship Incentive Payment Program - FY 1998 to FY 2021
Adoption Incentives program awards by category, fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2012
Adoption Reporting Systems
CB collects case-level data from every state on adoptions from foster care in order to analyze national trends. These analyses are then published both in print and on our website.
Our adoption reporting systems include:
The Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS)
Child Welfare Outcomes Report to Congress
Adoption Savings
The Children’s Bureau compiled data submitted by title IV-E agencies reporting their calculated “Adoption Savings” and their reported expenditure of those savings. These are savings that states and tribes experienced with respect to their own funds due to the expansion of eligibility under the federal title IV-E Adoption Assistance program. Federal law requires the Children’s Bureau to collect and post these data annually, beginning with data for federal fiscal year 2015.
Adoption Training and Technical Assistance
Adoption Training and Technical Assistance CB's Training and Technical Assistance Network helps to maintain a national photolisting of children available for adoption. Our network also provides assistance to states and tribes by recruiting adoptive parents and providing adoption and postadoption services. More training and technical assistance information can be found at:
AdoptUSKids provides a national photolisting service of children/youth available for adoption which supports and builds the capacity of state photolistings. This program also provides for an annual National Adoption Recruitment Campaign in conjunction with the AD Council and also provides localized supports to the state recruitment campaign efforts;
The National Resource Center for Diligent Recruitment provides training and technical assistance to the states, tribes and territories on all matters related to their diligent recruitment, development and support of foster and adoptive parents.
Diligent Recruitment of Families for Children in the Foster Care System: Challenges and Recommendations for Policy and Practice describes how child welfare agencies can improve diligent recruitment practices and services for resource families. It is based on grantee final reports and published research and presents activities undertaken by grantees, lessons learned, and suggestions for improvement.
Adoption Highlight
Adoption Excellence Awards recognize outstanding accomplishments in achieving permanency for America's children waiting in foster care. These awards honor those who contribute greatly to moving children from foster care to adoption or other permanent homes. Award recipients include states, local agencies, private organizations, courts, businesses, families and individuals.

Through the title IV-E Foster Care program, the Children’s Bureau supports states and participating  territories and tribes  to provide safe and stable out-of-home care for children and youth until they are safely returned home, placed permanently with adoptive families or legal guardians, or placed in other planned arrangements for permanency. The program is authorized by title IV-E of the Social Security Act, as amended, and implemented under the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 45 CFR parts 1355, 1356, and 1357. 
Foster Care Programs
CB provides funding to states and tribes to provide safe foster care placements for children and youth who cannot remain in their homes. Our funding also provides assistance to youth aging out of foster care so that they can achieve self-sufficiency.
The Children’s Bureau implements the following foster care programs:
The Title IV - E Foster Care Program
The John H. Chafee Foster Care Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood (Chafee)
How to Become a Foster Care Parent
The Children’s Bureau, together with its services, Child Welfare Information Gateway and AdoptUSKids, provides resources about the foster care system. See the following for more information and resources about becoming a foster parent and foster parenting:
How to Become a Foster Parent
Foster Care FAQs
Home Study Requirements for Prospective Foster Parents
Background Checks for Prospective Foster, Adoptive, and Kinship Caregivers
State Foster Care Information Websites
Children in Foster Care video from AdoptUSKids
Who Can Foster and Adopt
Foster Care Reporting Systems
The Children’s Bureau collects case-level information from states on all children in foster care, and we recently began collecting information on independent living services for youth in foster care and those who age out of care.
See the following for more information about our reporting systems:
The Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS)
The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD)
Foster Care Training and Technical Assistance
The Children’s Bureau provides training and technical assistance to states and tribes through its Capacity Building Collaborative:
The Capacity Building Center for States
The Capacity Building Center for Tribes
The Capacity Building Center for Courts
Additional resources are available through the following CB-funded entities: 
Child Welfare Information Gateway
National Child Welfare Workforce Institute (NCWWI)
National Training and Development Initiative for Foster and Adoptive Parents (NTDC)
Quality Improvement Center — Workforce Development
Center for Excellence in Foster Family Development
Special Initiative
The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and the Children’s Bureau value the input of youth/young adults who have lived experience in the foster care system. The ACF Youth Engagement Team 2020-2021 used the expertise of youth formerly in foster care to identify key recommendations toward achieving permanency for all children and youth waiting in foster care. This team of young adults provided specific recommendations on how agencies and courts could improve permanency outcomes by supporting connections with kin, securing relational permanency for youth, and achieving successful adoptions for older youth.
Letter From the Children’s Bureau Regarding the Foster Youth to Independence Initiative
ACF Youth Engagement Team
Recommendations for Improving Permanency and Well-Being 
Permanency Innovations Initiative
The federal Permanency Innovations Initiative (PII) was a multi-site federal demonstration project designed to improve permanency outcomes among foster care children who had the most serious barriers to permanency. This 5-year initiative included six grantees, each with a unique intervention designed to help a specific subgroup of children leave foster care in fewer than three years.

UC Contact Information
ORR Helpline for Unaccompanied Children or Sponsors
800.203.7001 | information@ORRNCC.com
 

Image
 

How does the ORR National Call Center help parents who are looking for their child?
The call center collects information from the caller and will send the information in real time regarding the caller’s inquiry to the shelter in which the child is located.
A caller may provide his/her name, contact information, their relationship to the child or child’s family, etc. 
The ORR shelter is then responsible for responding to a parent/sponsor/legal representative, after verifying the caller’s identity with the child or the child's family in the country of origin.
The call center does not verify or authenticate relationships, and therefore MAY NOT share the location or other personal information regarding the child with the caller.
Other helpful information:
Not every adult who comes forward to claim custody of a child is an appropriate sponsor due to a variety of reasons, which may include custodial disputes in the home country or environmental factors unsuitable for children.
Professional case managers conduct vigorous investigations to determine safe settings for children to be released to a sponsor.
The ORR National Call Center is experiencing an extraordinarily high volume of calls. To mitigate wait times and ensure rapid response, the call center has increased staffing during peak times.
To ensure the call center can focus on its critical mission of supporting children and families, ORR asks that members of the public, lawmakers and media do not use the 1-800 number. Inquiries can be forwarded to media@hhs.gov or UACProgram@acf.hhs.gov.
In addition to reunification support, the ORR National Call Center also serves children and sponsors post-reunification with issues that may include: finding resources in the community for education, medical care, emotional support, juvenile justice, substance use, legal support and safety; providing guidance on strengthening the relationship between sponsors and children; and receiving reports of abuse or neglect.
Request for Case File Information
Outside entities, attorneys or other individuals seeking UC case file information must make a request to ORR under the appropriate policies and procedures. Requesting parties should not make a FOIA request for UAC case file information.
Media Contact
Please visit ACF's Media Center page for contact details.

Update on Medication Abortion

While the April 7, 2023, Texas district court’s decision in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA threatens access to mifepristone, it is important to know that medication abortion continues to be approved and available for the time being. The Biden-Harris Administration will vigorously fight to protect access to critical reproductive health care and to medications that FDA has determined to be safe and effective. The Supreme Court has granted a stay while the case proceeds through the courts.
The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to protecting reproductive rights, ensuring women can make their own decisions about their own bodies, and preserving the FDA’s authority to make science-based determinations about what medications are safe and effective. Read statements from 
            President Joe Biden, 
            Vice President Kamala Harris, and  
            Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.
          






Know Your Rights: Reproductive Health Care


Reproductive health care, including access to birth control and safe and legal abortion care, is an
            essential part of your health and well-being. While Roe v. Wade was overturned, abortion remains
            legal in many states, and other reproductive health care services remain protected by law. The U.S.
            Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is committed to providing you with accurate and up-to-date
            information about access to and coverage of reproductive health care and resources. Our goal is to make sure
            you have appropriate information and support.

Below you will find information on your right to access care and have it covered by your insurance or other
            health care coverage if you have it, where to go if you don’t have coverage, and how to get information if
            you don’t know.
Most health insurance plans –  whether you get coverage through your employer, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, or elsewhere – cover family planning counseling, birth control, and other preventive services at no cost to you. Federal law allows for federally-funded plans (e.g. Medicaid) to cover abortion in certain circumstances, and some private health insurance plans also cover abortion care.



Your Right to Emergency Care







The
              Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA)
              requires that, for any individual showing up to a Medicare-participating hospital emergency room with an emergency medical condition, the hospital is required to offer the stabilizing medical care necessary to save your health or life, including abortion care. Emergency medical conditions involving pregnant patients may include, but are not limited to, ectopic pregnancy, complications of a pregnancy loss, or emergent hypertensive disorders, such as preeclampsia with severe features. To learn more click here.
Please note: pursuant to the preliminary injunction in Texas v. Becerra, No. 5:22-CV-185-H (N.D. Tex.), HHS may not enforce the following interpretations contained in the July 11, 2022, CMS guidance (and the corresponding letter sent the same day by HHS Secretary Becerra): (1) the Guidance and Letter’s interpretation that Texas abortion laws are preempted by EMTALA; and (2) the Guidance and Letter’s interpretation of EMTALA — both as to when an abortion is required and EMTALA’s effect on state laws governing abortion — within the State of Texas or against the members of the American Association of Pro Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG) and the Christian Medical and Dental Association (CMDA).




Your Right to Birth Control







Under the Affordable Care Act, most health plans are required to provide you with birth control and
              family planning counseling with no out-of-pocket costs. This includes, but is not limited to:

Hormonal methods, like birth control pills and vaginal rings
Implanted devices, like intrauterine devices (IUDs)
Emergency contraception, like Plan B® and ella® 
Barrier methods, like diaphragms and sponges
Patient education and counseling
Sterilization procedures
And any additional contraceptives approved, granted, or cleared by the FDA

To learn more about birth control coverage requirements for different types of health insurance plans,
              visit here. To learn more about contraceptive methods, visit here.




Your Right to Medication







Under guidance issued by HHS, roughly 60,000 U.S. retail pharmacies were reminded of the unique role they play in ensuring access to reproductive health care services under federal civil rights laws. The guidance makes clear that as recipients of federal financial assistance, pharmacies are prohibited under law from discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, and disability in their programs and activities.  This includes supplying medications; making determinations regarding the suitability of a prescribed medication for a patient; and advising patients about medications and how to take them. This action is one of many taken by HHS to support President Biden's directive to ensure access to reproductive health care, including abortion care.
Read the guidance sent to the nation's retail pharmacies




Your Right to Access Abortion







Following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, access to abortion will depend on the
              state you live in even more than before.

Medication abortion has been approved by the FDA since 2000 as a safe and effective option. Medication abortion currently is available by telehealth, including dispensing by mail via pharmacies and certified prescribers, in addition to in-person dispensing in clinics, medical offices, and hospitals.
If you are covered through Medicaid:
                
Under federal law, federal Medicaid funds cover abortion only in the circumstances of rape, incest or if the patient’s life is in danger. However, there are over a dozen states that provide more comprehensive coverage for abortion using state Medicaid funds. To find out more on state funding of abortions under Medicaid visit this website.


If you are covered through private health insurance (plans through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace or through your employer):
                
Coverage will vary by state, employer, and insurance company. In some states, private health insurance plans (e.g., plans through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace or through your employer) are required or allowed to cover abortion either in all or certain circumstances. Review your plan benefits document to find out whether your plan covers abortion. If you are using a plan where you are not the primary policy holder (e.g. if you are on a parent’s or spouse’s plan), be mindful that the policy holder may receive documentation from the plan, known as an “Explanation of Benefits,” that includes information about your care. 


If you need help paying for an abortion, abortion funds may be able to provide financial assistance.
                Information about abortion funds and resources to help are available at AbortionFinder.org
If you need information on your state’s laws or legal help, you may consider this website: AbortionFinder.org





Your Right to Access Other Preventive Health Services







Under law, most health insurance plans must cover certain other preventive health services with no out-of-pocket costs under the Affordable Care Act. Most health insurance plans are required to cover women’s preventive health services, including:

Well-woman visits to screen your health at any time, including a pap smear, breast exam and regular
                checkup
Counseling and screening services
Breast and cervical cancer screenings 
Prenatal care, which is care you would receive while pregnant 
Breastfeeding services and supplies
Interpersonal violence screening and counseling (e.g., sexual assault evidence collection exams) 
HIV screening and STI counseling





If You Do Not Have Health Insurance Coverage








Go to healthcare.gov and see if you qualify for coverage.
Title X Family Planning Clinics provide a broad range of family planning services and
                provide preventive health services that benefit reproductive health, such as STI and HIV testing, HIV
                counseling, and HPV vaccines. Find a Title X Family Planning Clinic near you.
Health centers are community-based organizations that deliver comprehensive,
                culturally competent, high-quality primary health care services, regardless of patients’ ability to pay,
                and charge for services on a sliding fee scale. Find a health center near you.
The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program helps low-income people with HIV receive medical
                care, medications, and essential support services to help them stay in care. Find how

Advancing Equity at HHS





HHS is committed to addressing inequities and advancing equity through assessing and changing policies, programs, and processes across the Department. Additionally, HHS is working to shift the culture, resources, and approaches to institutionalize and sustain a focus on equity over time.

HHS Equity Action Plan

The Department's plan highlights five illustrative areas to advance equity. The Department is engaged in comprehensive work beyond those mentioned in the plan, to ensure equity is a central component of policy and programmatic decision-making:
Nondiscrimination in HHS: Civil Rights Protections and Language Access
Acquisitions
Grants
Capacity Building
Maternal Mortality
Read the action plan

Select Equity Actions from 2021
Conducted equity assessments
Since the release of Executive Order 13985 on January 20, 2021, four HHS offices have conducted pilot equity assessments examining equity in their respective programs and policies related to:
administered grants
contracting
postpartum care
Benefit Enrollment Centers connecting Medicare beneficiaries with limited incomes to needed benefits
These efforts were used as an opportunity to test what equity assessment methods and approaches are viable across HHS and identify what is necessary to institutionalize robust equity assessments into our policy, program, and process decision-making.
Established the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE)
In August 2021. OCCHE addresses the impact of climate change on the health of the American people and serves as a department-wide hub for climate change and health policy, programming, and analysis, in pursuit of environmental justice and equitable health outcomes.
Developed the Minority Health Social Vulnerability Index
In 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and HHS Office of Minority Health partnered to develop the Minority Health Social Vulnerability Index, which enhances existing resources to support the identification of racial and ethnic communities at the greatest risk for disproportionate impact and adverse outcomes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Increased engagement with individuals directly affected by HHS policy and programs
As directed by EO 13995, HHS established the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force, which included 12 non-federal members representing a diversity of expertise and lived experience. 

Future Listening Sessions
HHS is interested in engaging with our partners and the public to receive feedback on our equity action plan and hear of other opportunities to advance opportunity using HHS programs and policies. Please stay tuned for additional information on HHS listening sessions on equity.

About HHS’s Health Disparities Council and Equity Team
The HHS Health Disparities Council is the Department’s coordinating and advisory body on health, health disparities, and health equity for racial and ethnic minorities and other underserved and marginalized populations. The Council is co-chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Health (ASH) and the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), with executive director support from the Office of Minority Health (OMH). All divisions across HHS are represented on the Health Disparities Council and help to steer the Department’s work on equity. The agency’s equity team is a group comprised of leadership and staff from OASH, ASPE, and OMH, who plan activities of the Health Disparities Council, coordinate equity work across human services, public health, and health in the Department, and support the implementation of equity-related directives at HHS. The equity team also coordinates equity-focused resources and learning sessions for HHS staff, with the goal of engaging all staff in the work of removing barriers and advancing equity for all.
About Executive Order 13985
On the first day of the Biden-Harris Administration, President Biden signed Executive Order 13985 on “Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government.” The Executive Order calls for a whole-of-government approach to advancing equity and opportunity in government practices, including: management; policymaking (including through regulation and guidance); procurement, contracting, and budgeting; delivery of benefits and services; and data collection, reporting, and use, to tangibly improve the lives of every person across the nation. The term ‘equity’ means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.

HHS FY 2023 Budget in Brief





The President's Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Budget invests in all Americans' health and well-being.  It addresses critical challenges and opportunities we face as a nation, including tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, expanding access to care, addressing health disparities, strengthening behavioral health, and promoting the well-being of children, families, and seniors.
HHS proposes $127.3 billion in discretionary and $1.7 trillion in mandatory budget authority for FY 2023.  This budget demonstrates the Administration's commitment to reinvesting in public health, research, and development to drive growth and shared prosperity for all Americans by making major investments in priority areas, including overdose prevention, mental health, maternal health, cancer, and HIV.  It also advances equity through the work of the federal government and helps ensure our programs serve people of color and other marginalized populations with the opportunities promised to all Americans.  The mandatory budget proposals in this budget improve care, drive quality, promote the well-being of the whole family, and focus on prevention.

Work With Us

Employee satisfaction at HHS has been growing steadily since 2014, making it one of the best places to work in the federal government.







 
 

"What I am most proud of is knowing I directly contribute to the mission by helping HHS hire employees to advance HHS’ great mission. The employees here are dedicated, who work hard and passionately every day!"
—   Marlene Harper, Health Resources and Services Administration


 
 

“I love how HHS is there to support and help the public; to keep them safe. I prefer HHS over the private sector because the focus isn’t on making money. It’s about helping our citizens — researching what we can — to help them be the best they can.”
—  Tonya McGee, Administrative Assistant, Federal Drug Administration


 
 

“I’m a caretaker type of personality. I know I don’t have the heart or stomach to do the work that nurses do. I’m not scientific enough to find the cure for cancer. But supporting the people who do that work is what matters. I can buy the beaker. I can make sure you know what to expect with work overseas. I love participating in something bigger that will help improve the world overall.”
—  Marjorie Ramsey, Educational Technician, Centers for Disease Control


 
 

“My HR role is managing contracts, but my job is to support the CDC’s global mission.”
—  James Williams, Management and Program Analyst, Operations Management Activity, Centers for Disease Control

Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Program





The Department’s DEIA program is largely decentralized and implemented through a hub and spoke model, with both a central office and eight OpDiv/StaffDiv level Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) (collectively EEO/D&I) offices with separate chains of command.
The Office of Equal Employment Opportunity, Diversity & Inclusion (EEODI) is within the Assistant Secretary for Administration’s (ASA) office and its mission is to promote, encourage, develop, and maintain a culture of equality, fairness, and objectivity throughout HHS.
EEODI’s goals include:
Integrating equal employment opportunity (EEO) and inclusion concepts into all aspects of the workplace.
Maintaining a workforce that reflects the diversity of the United States.
Providing fair, neutral, timely and effective complaint processing.
Improving HHS’ workforce knowledge on anti-discrimination and anti-harassment matters.
Establishing and sustaining a robust barrier identification and elimination program.
EEODI is responsible for administering and overseeing the Department-level DEIA program. In addition to establishing new programs, EEODI also collaborates with the eight EEO and D&I offices within OpDivs to ensure DEIA is centered at all levels within the Department (StaffDivs do not have their own independent EEO/D&I offices). Each EEO/D&I office reports directly to their OpDiv leadership. The DEIA programs within each OpDiv/StaffDiv are similar in many respects. Most of the OpDiv/StaffDivs manage EEO complaint processing, Special Emphasis Programs, D&I programs, Accessibility Services, supervisory and workforce training, and data analytics through their EEO Offices. Moreover, most of the OpDiv/StaffDivs use their Information Technology or Chief Information office to manage the Section 508 Accessibility program, while most of the Human Resources offices administer the anti-harassment programs.

Work With Us

Employee satisfaction at HHS has been growing steadily since 2014, making it one of the best places to work in the federal government.







 
 

"What I am most proud of is knowing I directly contribute to the mission by helping HHS hire employees to advance HHS’ great mission. The employees here are dedicated, who work hard and passionately every day!"
—   Marlene Harper, Health Resources and Services Administration


 
 

“I love how HHS is there to support and help the public; to keep them safe. I prefer HHS over the private sector because the focus isn’t on making money. It’s about helping our citizens — researching what we can — to help them be the best they can.”
—  Tonya McGee, Administrative Assistant, Federal Drug Administration


 
 

“I’m a caretaker type of personality. I know I don’t have the heart or stomach to do the work that nurses do. I’m not scientific enough to find the cure for cancer. But supporting the people who do that work is what matters. I can buy the beaker. I can make sure you know what to expect with work overseas. I love participating in something bigger that will help improve the world overall.”
—  Marjorie Ramsey, Educational Technician, Centers for Disease Control


 
 

“My HR role is managing contracts, but my job is to support the CDC’s global mission.”
—  James Williams, Management and Program Analyst, Operations Management Activity, Centers for Disease Control

Digital Accessibility @ HHS





HHS’ Role in Accessibility
The Department has an obligation to its employees and members of the public to provide the same (or comparable) access to, and use of, information and services from an HHS OpDiv sought by each and every individual. As a Department, we believe everyone is accountable and responsible for accessibility conformance.
The accessibility field encompasses many types of technology, standards and guidelines. As a Department of the federal government, we are required to abide by the Section 508 legislation. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, codified at section 29 USC 794d, as amended, ensures those with disabilities have equal access to government information as contained on information and communications technology (ICT), and thereby to the government employment, programs and services to which all citizens are entitled. Section 508 is only one segment of the accessibility field. As use of information technology (IT) has greatly increased within the workplace, and out, in recent years, and additional legislation has required ever-more access to government information, there is a great need for strong, effective action to ensure compliance across the Department.
What does it mean to be accessible?
Accessibility can be measured by how successfully a person with a disability can locate, get to, and understand the wanted or needed information. Accessibility results in benefits like eliminating barriers to ICT and encouraging development of technologies and techniques.
Who is impacted by inaccessible content?
A disability is any condition that limits a person’s movements, senses, or activities. Recognized groups of disabilities include:
Photosensitive epilepsy
Cognitive impairments
Limited language, cognitive, and learning abilities
Deaf or limited hearing
Blind or limited vision
Without perception of color
Non-verbal or limited speech
Limited manipulation; and,
Limited reach and strength.
What types of content are required to be accessible?
All external public facing content and non-public facing official agency communications. ICT and internal official agency communications include, but are not limited to, the following.
Web, desktop and mobile technologies;
Printers, scanners, phones, and kiosks;
Software used but not purchased by the federal government;
Email, PDFs, Microsoft Office documents, support material;
Posting to and the use of social media sites;
A survey questionnaire; a template or form;
Educational or training materials;
Intranet content designed as a webpage;
An emergency notification;
An initial or final decision adjudicating an administrative;
claim or proceeding; a formal acknowledgement of receipt;
An internal or external program or policy announcement;
A notice of benefits, program eligibility, employment; and,
opportunity, or personnel action.
Inaccessible content puts the Department at risk of legal action. Important: It is the responsibility of the content or system owner to ensure their content, system, product or service is accessible.
Contact the OS Accessibility Program
Feedback and inquiries regarding accessibility and Section 508 pertaining to the Department or OS can be directed to the HHS Accessibility Help Desk. Requests for training or conformance evaluation are encouraged.
Definitions
Assistive Technology (AT)?
Any device, software, or equipment that helps people adapt their environment. Examples include text-to-speech, dictation, closed captioning, high contrast, and alternate input devices.
Electronic Content
Electronic content that is not public facing shall conform to the applicable accessibility requirements when such content constitutes official business and is communicated by an agency through one or more of the following:
An emergency notification;
An initial or final decision adjudicating an administrative claim or proceeding;
An internal or external program or policy announcement;
A notice of benefits, program eligibility, employment opportunity, or personnel action;
A formal acknowledgement of receipt;
A survey questionnaire;
A template or form;
Educational or training materials; or
Intranet content designed as a webpage.
ICT is any IT, equipment, or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment for which the principal function is the creation, conversion, duplication, automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, reception, or broadcast of data or information. Examples of ICT are:
Electronic content;
Telecommunications products;
Computers and ancillary equipment;
Software;
Information kiosks and transaction machines;
IT services;
Multifunction office machines which copy, scan, and fax documents.
Web based intranet or Internet information and applications;
Multimedia (including video and pictures); and
Other related resources defined by the Administrator.
Section 508 and WCAG?
Section 508 is a law that states anytime the federal government develops, procures, maintains, or uses ICT employees and members of the public with disabilities seeking information, data or services from the Department must have the same or comparable access as those without disabilities. Section 508 conformance is achieved by meeting a set of technical standards. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of standards used by individuals, organizations, and governments worldwide to ensure text, images, sounds, and code or markup that define structure or presentation are accessible to all users.

Information Automatically Collected and Stored
When you visit our websites, we use Google's Universal Analytics (UA) software to automatically gather and temporarily store a variety of information about your visit. The basic information we collect during your visit includes:
The name of the domain you use to access the Internet (for example, Verizon.com if you are using a Verizon online account or stanford.edu if you are connecting from Stanford University's domain);
The date and time of your visit to our website;
The pages and documents you viewed on our website;
The URL of the website you visited prior to ours;
The type and version of your Web browser and operating system; and
Your location at the time of your visit, down to the city-level.
We do not associate any of the data we automatically collect with your personally identifiable information (PII). Instead, we aggregate this data from all users' visits in order to improve our website and provide a better user experience to our visitors. The aggregate data is available only to Web managers and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties. We retain this information only for as long as needed for proper analysis. The Google Analytics Privacy Policy is available at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Voluntarily Submitted to HHS
If you choose to provide HHS with your personally identifiable information (PII) —for example, by completing a "Contact Us" form, leaving a comment, sending an email, or completing a survey—we may use that information to respond to your message and/or help us get you the information or services you requested. Submitting personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, address, telephone number, email address, etc. is voluntary and is not required to access information on our website.
We retain the information only for as long as necessary to respond to your question or request, in most cases no longer than three months. We maintain and destroy information submitted electronically as required by the Federal Records Act and the National Archives and Records Administration's (NARA) records schedules. It may be subject to disclosure in certain cases (for example, if required by a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, court order, or Congressional access request, or if authorized by a Privacy Act SORN). The information is subject to the Privacy Act if maintained in a Privacy Act system.
HHS also automatically receives information when you visit our websites that is not personally identifiable information (PII). For more information, see Information Automatically Collected and Stored.

HHS FOIA and Privacy Act Statutes and Resources
HHS System of Records Notices
Interaction with Children Online
The Department will take all reasonable steps necessary to protect the privacy and safety of any child from whom we collect information, as required by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). A child's parent or guardian is required to provide consent before HHS collects, uses, or shares personally identifiable information (PII) from a child under age 13.
Specific HHS websites will provide information and instructions for how we obtain consent when collecting information about a child. The website will specify exactly what how the information is used, who sees it, and how long it is kept.
If you are under 13 and visit any websites, the law says that you and your parents are in charge of what personally identifiable information (PII) the websites can know about you. Some examples of personally identifiable information (PII) are your full name, home address, email address, phone number, age, and gender.
Cookies
Websites can automatically place small text files, known as "cookies," on their visitors' computers. Cookies identify the unique browser used by the visitor unless you delete them or they expire. On each subsequent visit to the website, the visitor's browser will retrieve the cookie, allowing HHS to aggregate the number of return visitors. HHS uses "cookies" to test and optimize our websites' design and content. We use two types of cookies on HHS websites:

We do not use session cookies to collect personally identifiable information (PII), and we do not share data collected from session cookies.
We use multi-session cookies, or persistent cookies, to customize our website for frequent visitors and to test variations of website design and content. Multi-session cookies are cookies that are stored over more than a single session on your computer. We do not use multi-session cookies to collect personally identifiable information (PII), and we do not share data collected from multi-session cookies. Our multi-session cookies expire two years after your last visit to our website. These cookies delete automatically from your computer as soon as they expire.

On some portions of our website, we have enabled Google's Universal Analytics (UA) and other third-party software (listed below) to provide aggregate demographic and interest data of our visitors. While some websites use these tools to present you with advertisements, HHS only uses them to measure demographic data. HHS has no control over advertisements presented to you on other websites. This means that third-party vendors, including Google, may show you public health campaign advertisements created by HHS and its agencies on non-government websites based on your visits to HHS websites. For the software listed below, we have included links to the company's websites where you can opt-out of having these tools collect data and/or serve you interest-based advertising.
DoubleClick: HHS uses DoubleClick to understand the characteristics and demographics of the people who visit HHS websites. HHS staff only conducts analyses on the aggregated data from DoubleClick. DoubleClick does not collect personally identifiable information (PII) from HHS websites. The DoubleClick Privacy Policy is available at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.
You can opt-out of receiving DoubleClick advertising at https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en.
Quantcast: HHS uses Quantcast to understand the characteristics and demographics of the people who visit HHS websites. HHS staff only conducts analyses on the aggregated data from Quantcast. Quantcast does not collect personally identifiable information (PII) from HHS websites. The Quantcast Privacy Policy is available at https://www.quantcast.com/how-we-do-it/consumer-choice/privacy-policy/.
You can opt-out of Quantcast at https://www.quantcast.com/opt-out/.
Third-Party Websites and Applications Used by HHS
HHS maintains official pages or accounts on third-party websites in order to better engage and communicate with the public. Third-party websites are websites that we do not maintain or control. We have accounts on some third-party websites so we can connect with people interested in health and human services information. Examples of third-party websites that HHS uses include YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
All official HHS information available on third-party websites is also available on HHS websites. The third-party website's security and privacy policies govern your activity on their website. Users of third-party websites often share information with the public, user communities, and/or the third-party organization operating the website. It is important for you to review the privacy policies of third-party websites so you understand how they use and share your information. You should also adjust the privacy settings of your account on any third-party website to match your preferences.
If you have an account or profile with a third-party website and choose to follow, like, friend, or comment on a third-party website managed by HHS, certain personally identifiable information (PII) associated with your account may be available to us based on the privacy policies of the third-party website and your privacy settings within that website. We do not share personally identifiable information available through these websites.
HHS conducts and publishes a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for each use of a third-party website. Each use of a third-party website may have unique features or practices. HHS sometimes collects and uses the information made available through third-party websites.
In order to comply with the Federal Records Act, HHS archives some information that users submit or publish when engaging with the HHS through official HHS pages or accounts on third-party websites (e.g., by sending a message, posting a comment, "following," "friending," or taking similar actions). This information may contain personally identifiable information (PII), such as an individual's username, other public account information, and any information provided in a message or comment, when such information is available based on the user's privacy settings and the terms of the site. For example:
On Facebook, HHS may automatically archive posts, messages, replies and comments sent to or from official HHS.gov accounts in the following sections: 'About,' 'Albums,' 'Event details,' 'Event discussions,' 'Photo activity,' 'Private messages,' 'Reviews' and 'Timeline activity'.
HHS uses the following third-party websites and applications.
AddThis: HHS offers AddThis on its websites, giving visitors the option to bookmark and share HHS website content on certain social media websites. Using AddThis on HHS websites does not require registration or personally identifiable information (PII). The AddThis Privacy Policy is available at http://www.addthis.com/privacy.
ArchiveSocial: HHS uses ArchiveSocial to interface directly with each social network to capture and preserve data in its native form. The ArchiveSocial Privacy Policy is available at https://archivesocial.com/privacy/.
Bit.ly: HHS uses Bit.ly to shorten long URLs for use in email and social media messages. Bit.ly provides analytics on how many people clicked on the URLs distributed by HHS. Bit.ly analytics do not provide any personally identifiable information (PII) about the visitors who click the shortened links. The Bit.ly Privacy Policy is available at http://bit.ly/pages/privacy.
CrazyEgg: HHS uses CrazyEgg to obtain information on how visitors are interacting with specific pages on HHS.gov websites. This allows HHS to evaluate and, if necessary or beneficial, to modify its websites to improve value and usability. The data CrazyEgg collects includes information about how visitors navigate around a website and the most commonly clicked links on a specific page. CrazyEgg does not collect personally identifiable information (PII). The Crazy Egg Privacy Policy is available at http://www.crazyegg.com/privacy.
Google AdWords: HHS occasionally uses Google AdWords to provide online advertisement delivery and tracking. HHS may employ tools provided by Google AdWords to support Display Advertising, including Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, data collection via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. This means that third-party vendors, including Google, may show you public health campaign advertisements created by HHS and its agencies on non-government websites based on your visits to HHS websites. To implement these tools, HHS and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies and third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to HHS websites. These cookies collect information about visits to HHS websites, but do not collect personally identifiable information (PII). The Google AdWords Privacy Policy is available at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.
Google Analytics: HHS may employ tools provided by Google Analytics to support Display Advertising, including Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, data collection via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration and/or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. This means that third-party vendors, including Google, may show you public health campaign advertisements created by HHS and its agencies on non-government websites based on your visits to HHS websites. To implement these tools, HHS and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies and third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to HHS websites. These cookies collect information about visits to HHS websites, but do not collect personally identifiable information (PII). The Google Analytics Privacy Policy is available at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.
Pagefreezer: HHS uses Pagefreezer archiving software to archive content from the HHS.gov website and five topical websites. This software does not require users to submit personally identifiable information (PII), nor does HHS ask for this information. Pagefreezer Privacy Policy is available at https://www.pagefreezer.com/privacy-policy/.
Qualtrics: HHS uses Qualtrics survey software approved by the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FEDRamp) to collect feedback from HHS website visitors. Qualtrics is implemented on HHS websites both as on-page and pop-up surveys. HHS uses survey results to measure visitor satisfaction with HHS websites. This survey software does not require users to submit personally identifiable information (PII), nor does HHS ask for this information in its surveys. The survey reports are available only to HHS managers, members of the HHS Communications and Web Teams, and other designated HHS staff who require this information to perform their job duties. The Qualtrics Privacy Policy is available at https://www.qualtrics.com/privacy-statement/.
Salesforce: HHS uses Salesforce to email newsletters and other messages to visitors who subscribe to them on HHS websites. Only HHS staff and managers who email newsletters using Salesforce or monitor the results of email initiatives have access to the subscriber lists. Salesforce never allows access to the subscriber lists to anyone outside of HHS for any purpose. Salesforce also provides aggregate data, such as email open rates and total clicks on links. The Salesforce Privacy Policy is available at https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/full_privacy/.
Siteimprove: HHS uses Siteimprove to manage our website. It provides the ASPA Digital team with information allowing them to make incremental changes to the sites managed by this team. Areas that Siteimprove provides information includes broken links, misspellings, accessibility, analytics, etc. Only HHS staff and managers who manage the ASPA managed websites have access to the Siteimprove information. The Siteimprove Privacy Policy is available at https://siteimprove.com/en/privacy/privacy-policy/.
Widgets: HHS offers widgets that provide specific HHS site content to any website that includes the widget code. You can install an HHS widget on any website simply by adding the HHS-provided code to a website's source HTML code. If you choose to install HHS widgets, they will not collect any type of personally identifiable information (PII) from your websites visitors.
Website Security
In order to maintain website security and ensure HHS websites are available to the public, we use software programs to monitor traffic and identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise cause damage to HHS websites. Law enforcement may use information from these tools to help identify an individual in the event of investigations and as part of any required legal process.
The U.S. Government maintains this website and there are federal laws that protect it. The government can arrest and prosecute individuals for illegal activity if they violate these laws.

HHS FY 2024 Budget in Brief





The President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget advances the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) mission to promote Americans’ health and well-being. HHS proposes $144.3 billion in discretionary and $1.7 trillion in mandatory proposed budget authority for FY 2024.
This budget addresses urgent challenges our country is facing today—including a growing behavioral health crisis, need to prepare for future public health threats, and large arrival of unaccompanied children and refugees.
The budget also works to secure a healthier, more vibrant future for all Americans by investing in expanded coverage and access to care; addressing the needs of those most at risk, including Indian country, children, families, and seniors; growing our health workforce; and advancing science to improve health.
And to support HHS’s mission, the budget invests in cross-cutting needs for enhanced program operations and mission-critical infrastructure.

							Today, I signed an Executive Order strengthening how our military handles sexual assault and serious offenses.   Ending gender-based violence has been a priority for me throughout my career.   This represents a turning point for survivors of gender-based violence in the military.						






 

									Today, on what would’ve been Emmett Till’s 82nd birthday, we add a chapter of remembrance and healing to the story.  Just as we came together when I signed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, today we gather as I designate the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument.

									For the longest time, we’ve been told to give up on American manufacturing.  But I never believed that. We can lead the world in manufacturing again.  During my visit to Philadelphia, I saw proof that Bidenomics is working.								



 

									Folks, our mental health crisis is something we need to face together.  We have an obligation to be there for each other and ask for help when we need it.  I want every American to know that their country has their back, and their president has their back.								



 

									A job is about dignity – it’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say: “It’s going to be okay.”   And thanks to Bidenomics, we've created 13.2 million of them.

									Extremists in Florida approved new education standards that push a dangerous lie that enslaved people benefited from slavery.  The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to oppose efforts to distort American history and take our country backwards.								



 

									Today, my Administration is announcing additional steps to help states and cities fight extreme heat.  The naysayers on climate change can’t deny the impact it’s having on Americans. We're taking action.								



 

									It’s unfortunate to see Senators who don’t want their constituents to get automatic student loan relief:   56,930 of Senator Scott’s constituents are eligible for automatic loan relief under this Administration’s fixes to the Income-Driven Repayment plan.								



 

									Under President Biden’s leadership, there’s been more than $16 billion in new offshore wind investments – including 18 offshore wind vessels, 12 manufacturing facilities, and 13 ports.								



 

									We’re working with internet service providers to bring down prices for Americans struggling with payments.  It's called the Affordable Connectivity Program, and right now, it’s helping 19 million families.  GetInternet.gov.

CMS.gov Privacy Policy
Protecting your privacy is very important to us. This privacy policy describes what information we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it.  This privacy notice covers CMS.gov, marketplace.cms.gov, innovation.cms.gov, partnershipforpatients.cms.gov, and hfpp.cms.gov.  These websites are referred to as “CMS.gov” throughout the rest of this notice and are maintained and operated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).  The privacy notice for other CMS websites not listed above is available at https://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/Agency-Information/Aboutwebsite/Privacy-Policy.html.
CMS.gov doesn’t collect name, contact information, or other similar information through these websites unless you choose to provide it. We do collect other, limited, non-personally identifiable information automatically from visitors who read, browse, and/or download information from our website. We do this so we can understand how the website is being used and how we can make it more helpful. For more information, see Types of information we collect.
Personally identifiable information (PII), defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), refers to information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, like their name, Medicare Number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, like date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc. Medicare Fee-for-Service eligibility and enrollment information and claims data are considered protected health information (PHI) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (1996) (HIPAA) regulations.
We don’t sell any information you provide when you visit CMS.gov. For information on how we share information, see How CMS uses information collected on CMS.gov.
 
Types of information we collect
Information which is automatically collected:
When you browse:
Certain information about your visit can be collected when you browse websites. When you browse CMS.gov, we, and in some cases, our third-party service providers, can collect the following types of information about your visit, including:
Domain from which you accessed the internet (like Verizon.com if you’re using a Verizon account).
IP address (an IP or internet protocol address is a number that’s automatically assigned to a device connected to the internet).
Approximate geographic location based on the IP address of the user’s local system.
Operating system for the device that you’re using and information about the browser you used when visiting the site. The operating system is software that directs a computer’s basic functions, like executing programs and managing storage.
Date and time of your visit.
Pages you visited.
Address of the website that connected you to CMS.gov (like Google.com or Bing.com).
Device type (like desktop computer, tablet, or type of mobile device).
Screen resolution.
Browser language.
Geographic location.
Time spent on page.
Scroll depth (measures how much of a web page was viewed).
Your actions on CMS.gov (like clicking a button).
For more information, see How CMS uses third-party websites & applications with CMS.gov.
We use this information to:
Measure the number of visitors to CMS.gov.
Help make our website more useful for visitors.
Improve our public education and outreach through digital advertising.
Also, this information is sometimes used to personalize the content we show you on third-party sites. For more information on our practices, see How CMS uses third-party websites & applications with CMS.gov.
 
Information you may provide:
When you request information:
We collect information, including your email address, to deliver alerts or eNewsletters. We use this information to complete the subscription process and provide you with information. You can opt out of these communications at any time by editing your subscription preferences.
 
How CMS uses information collected on CMS.gov
Sending you CMS messages:
We use the email address you provide us to send emails related to CMS.
Conducting surveys to improve services:
We use online surveys to collect opinions and feedback. You don’t have to answer these questions. If you do answer these questions, don’t include any PII/PHI in your answers. We analyze and use the information from these surveys to improve the CMS.gov website. The information is available only to CMS managers, members of the CMS communications and web teams, and other designated federal staff and contractors who require this information to perform their duties.
Using third-party tools for website analytics
We use a variety of third-party web tools for web analytics. We don’t collect any PII/PHI with these tools.  We use these tools to collect basic information about visits to CMS.gov. This information is then used to maintain the website, including:
Monitoring website stability
Measuring website traffic
Optimizing website content
Helping make the website more useful to visitors
CMS staff analyzes the data collected from these tools. Reports are available only to CMS managers, teams who implement programs represented on CMS.gov, members of the CMS communications and web teams, and other designated federal staff and contractors who need this information to perform their jobs.
 
Using third-party tools for outreach and education through digital advertising:
We use third-party web services to conduct outreach and education through the use of digital advertising for CMS.gov. These third-party services may collect information through the use of web beacons (also called pixels) that are located on our pages. A web beacon is a see-through graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that's placed on a web page and, in combination with a cookie, allows us to collect information regarding the use of the web page that contains the web beacon.
We use web beacons to tell when a user is redirected to CMS.gov by clicking or otherwise interacting with a CMS advertisement that we ran on another website. This is known as “click tracking” or “conversion tracking,” and we use it to better target CMS advertisements (known as “retargeting”) to inform consumers about the services available through CMS.gov. For more information on how these tools work, see How CMS uses third-party websites & applications with CMS.gov.
We also use third-party tools to help deliver advertising. Vendors that operate the third-party tools may also gather information about your visits to third-party sites outside of CMS.gov. While we don't track your internet activity outside of CMS.gov, our vendors may use information collected automatically by visiting CMS.gov, and combine it with data they collect elsewhere for targeted advertising purposes. You can opt out of this type of data collection via Privacy Manager, Ad Choices, and Do Not Track. For methods to opt out of this type of collection, see Your choices about tracking & data collection on CMS.gov.
The outreach and education analytics tools provide reports which aggregate data like the number of clicks on advertisements. The reports are available only to CMS managers, teams who implement programs represented on CMS.gov, members of the CMS.gov communications and web teams, and other designated federal staff and contractors who need this information to perform their duties.
 
How CMS uses cookies & other technologies on CMS.gov
The Office of Management and Budget Memo M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies, allows federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies to improve the delivery of services.
When you visit a website, its server may generate a piece of text known as a “cookie” to place on your device. The cookie, which is unique to your browser, allows the server to "remember" specific information about your visit while you’re connected. The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of web pages. Information that you enter into CMS.gov isn’t associated with cookies on CMS.gov. Depending on the third-party tool’s business practices, privacy policies, terms of service, and/or the privacy settings you selected, information you’ve provided to third parties could be used to identify you when you visit CMS.gov. These third parties don’t/won’t share your identity with CMS or the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
There are 2 types of cookies - single session (temporary) and multi-session (persistent). Single session cookies last only as long as your internet browser is open. Once you close your browser, the session cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your device for longer periods. Both types of cookies create an ID that’s unique to your device.
Session cookies: We use session cookies for technical purposes, like to allow better navigation through our website. These cookies let our server know that you’re continuing a visit to our website. The OMB Memo M-10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as "Usage Tier 1—Single Session.” The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of single session web measurement and customization technologies."
Persistent cookies: We use persistent cookies to understand the differences between new and returning visitors to CMS.gov. Persistent cookies remain on your device between visits to our website until they expire or are removed by the user. The OMB Memorandum M-10-22 Guidance defines our use of persistent cookies as "Usage Tier 2—Multi-session without personally identifiable information.” The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of multi-session web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected." We don’t use persistent cookies to collect PII. We don’t identify a user by using cookies.
CMS also uses these technologies on CMS.gov:
Persistent cookies for digital advertising: Similar to persistent cookies identified above, CMS uses persistent cookies for outreach through digital advertising. These cookies can also be created on third-party websites and remain on your device between visits to our website until they expire or you remove them. Consistent with OMB guidance for “Usage Tier 2”, we don’t use persistent cookies for outreach to collect PII. CMS doesn’t identify a user by using such technologies.
Web beacons for digital advertising (also called pixels and/or tracking tags): See-through images placed on certain pages of CMS.gov are typically used in conjunction with cookies and aren’t stored on your device. When you access these pages, web beacons generate a notice of your visit. For information on how we use web beacons, see How CMS uses third-party websites & applications with CMS.gov.
Website log files: These are used as an analysis tool and to tell how visitors use CMS.gov, how often they return, and how they navigate through the website.
Flash: Flash is used to assess the performance of the site and as a player for selected videos depending on the browser a device is using.
Local Storage Objects: We use Flash Local Storage Objects (“LSOs”) to store your preferences and to personalize your visit.
 
Your choices about tracking & data collection on CMS.gov
CMS.gov offers a Privacy Manager which gives you control over what tracking and data collection takes place during your visit. Third-party tools are enabled by default to provide a quality consumer experience.
The Privacy Manager provides you with the choice to opt in or to opt out of the different categories of third-party tools used by CMS.gov: Advertising, Analytics, or Social Media. The Privacy Manager prevents cookies, web beacons, and Local Storage Objects from being placed on your device. The Privacy Manager also prevents third-party tools from loading regardless of your cookie settings, which provides you with an additional layer of privacy that prevents the tool from loading at all. Because the Privacy Manager creates a cookie in your browser, the opt in and opt out choices you make through the Privacy Manager will only be effective on the device and browser you used to make your choices, and your choices will expire when the cookie expires. Once the cookie is created, the Privacy Manager will retain your settings for 3 years from the date of your most recent visit. You may revisit the Privacy Manager to change or renew your choices at any time.
Modify privacy options
If you disable cookies in your browser, our Privacy Manager won’t be able to store your preferences and won’t function properly. If you don’t wish to use our Privacy Manager to opt out of the tools used by CMS.gov, you can opt out of tools individually, or via the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) AdChoices icon, discussed in the next subsection.
If you opt out of the tools used by CMS.gov via the Privacy Manager or by opting out of the tools directly, you’ll still have access to information and resources at CMS.gov.
AdChoices: We include the AdChoices icon on all digital advertising that uses “conversion tracking” or “retargeting.” To learn about conversion tracking, targeted advertising, and retargeting, see How CMS uses third-party websites & applications with CMS.gov. The AdChoices icon is usually at or near the corner of digital ads. When you click on the AdChoices icon, it will provide information on what company served the ad and information on how to opt out. Learn more about AdChoices.
Do Not Track: We automatically observe the “Do Not Track” browser setting for digital advertising that uses “conversion tracking” or “retargeting.” If “Do Not Track” is set before a device visits CMS.gov, third-party conversion tracking and retargeting tools won’t load on the website. To learn more about conversion tracking and retargeting, see How CMS uses third-party websites & applications with CMS.gov. Learn more about Do Not Track and how to set the Do Not Track setting in your browser.
 
How CMS uses third-party websites & applications with CMS.gov
CMS.gov uses a variety of technologies and social media services to communicate and interact with the public. These third-party websites and applications include popular social networking and media websites, open source software communities, and more.
Third-party websites:
Your activity on the third-party websites that CMS.gov links to (like Facebook or Twitter) is governed by the security and privacy policies of those websites. You should review the privacy policies of all websites before using them so you understand how your information may be used.
Website analytics tools:
These tools collect basic site usage information, like:
How many visits CMS.gov gets
The pages visited
Time spent on CMS.gov
The number of return visits to CMS.gov
The approximate geographic location of the device used to access CMS.gov
Types of devices used
This information is used to maintain the website, including:
Monitoring website stability
Measuring website traffic
Optimizing website content
Improving your experience
Use the CMS.gov Privacy Manager to opt out of website analytics tools.
 
Digital advertising tools for outreach & education:
We use third-party tools to support our digital advertising outreach and education efforts. These tools enable us to reach new people and provide information to previous visitors. To use these tools, we use these technologies on CMS.gov:
Click tracking: We use click tracking to identify the ads that are most helpful to consumers and efficient for outreach. This enables us to improve the performance of ads that consumers click on. When users click on links from ads, data about what ad was viewed is collected. Reports are generated about ad performance – including the total number of views and clicks an ad received.
Conversion tracking: We use conversion tracking to identify ads that are helpful to consumers and efficient for outreach. It enables us to improve the performance of ads viewed by consumers. When a CMS.gov ad is viewed on a third-party site (like a banner ad), a cookie is placed in the browser of the device the ad was viewed on. If this device later visits CMS.gov, the visit is linked to the ad viewed on the same device. Use the CMS.gov Privacy Manager to opt out of advertising tools. Users can click on the “AdChoices” icon in the corner of our ads to opt out of this Ad Targeting. Users who have set their browser to “Do Not Track” will automatically be opted out of conversion tracking. For more information about AdChoices and Do Not Track, see Your choices about tracking & data collection on CMS.gov.
Retargeting: We use retargeting to provide information to consumers who have previously visited CMS.gov, like reminders about upcoming enrollment deadlines. Retargeting enables us to improve the performance of ads by delivering them to relevant audiences, like recent visitors to CMS.gov. During a visit to CMS.gov, a cookie is placed in the browser of the devices used to view the website. When that same device is used to visit third-party websites that are displaying CMS.gov ads, ads for CMS.gov may be shown to that device because it had previously visited CMS.gov. Using these cookies, we don't collect information about the third-party websites visited by a device. Reports are generated about ad performance – including the total number of views and clicks an ad received. Use the CMS.gov Privacy Manager to opt out of advertising tools. Users can click on the “AdChoices” icon in the corner of our ads to opt out of this Ad Targeting. Users who have set their browser to “Do Not Track” will automatically be opted out of conversion tracking. For more information about AdChoices and Do Not Track, see Your choices about tracking & data collection on CMS.gov.
Targeted advertising: We use third-party vendors to engage in targeted advertising (also called online behavioral or interest-based advertising) to provide information to consumers across their online activities. Targeted advertising involves the collection of data from a particular computer or device. Data regarding web viewing behaviors or application use is gathered to predict user preferences or interests. We can have ads delivered to computers or devices based on the preferences or interests inferred from the web-viewing behaviors or application use.
Third-party vendors engaged by us may also target advertising based on information automatically collected (not information you provide) when you browse our websites or other websites on the internet. You can opt out of this type of data collection via our Privacy Manager, Ad Choices, and Do Not Track. For methods to opt out of this type of collection, see Your choices about tracking & data collection on CMS.gov.
We may consider new third-party tools or the use of new third-party websites, but we'll first assess the tool or website before it’s used in connection with CMS.gov. We'll provide notice to the public before adding any new tool to CMS.gov. These assessments include a description about how information will be collected, accessed, secured, and stored. See a list of the third-party tools currently being used on CMS.gov. See risk assessments for third-party websites and applications.
 
How CMS protects your personal information
You don’t have to give us personal information when you visit CMS.gov, but if you want to get alerts or e-newsletters, you’ll need to give us your email address to subscribe.
If you choose to give us PII in an email, request for information, paper or electronic form, questionnaire, survey, etc., we’ll the information you give us only long enough to respond to your question or to fulfill the stated purpose of the communication.
If we need to contact you, we’ll save your personal information in a record system designed to retrieve information about you by personal identifier (name, personal email address, home mailing address, personal or mobile phone number, etc.) and keep the information you give us safe according to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. Section 552a).
If we have a record system to retrieve information about you so we can carry out our mission, a Privacy Act Notification Statement should be prominently displayed out in the open on the public-facing website or form asking you for PII. The statement has to address these 5 criteria:
The legal authorization we have to collect information about you
Why we’re collecting information
Routine ways we disclose information outside of our websites
Whether or not you legally have to give us the information we’re asking for
What happens if you choose to not us the information we’re asking for
For more information about CMS.gov’s privacy policy, email Privacy@cms.hhs.gov.
Third-party services are web-based technologies that aren’t exclusively operated or controlled by a government entity, or that involve significant participation of a nongovernment entity. These services may be separate websites or may be applications embedded within our websites. The list of third-party services includes links to relevant third-party privacy policies.
 
How long CMS keeps data & how it’s accessed
We'll keep data collected long enough to achieve the specified objective for which they were collected. Once the specified objective is achieved, the data will be retired or destroyed in accordance with published draft records schedules of CMS as approved by the National Archives and Records Administration.
We don't store information from cookies on our systems. The persistent cookies used with third-party tools on CMS.gov can be stored on a user’s local system and are set to expire at varying time periods depending upon the cookie. We assess whether the expiration date of a cookie exceeds one year and provides an explanation as to why cookies with a longer life are used on the site in the associated Third-Party Website or Application Privacy Impact Assessment.
 
Children & privacy on CMS.gov
We believe it’s important to protect the privacy of children online. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) governs information gathered online from or about children under the age of 13. CMS.gov isn’t intended to solicit information of any kind from children under age 13.
 
Links to other sites
CMS.gov may link to other HHS websites, other government websites, and/or private organizations (like health care providers). We link to other websites solely for your convenience and education. When you follow a link to an external site, you’re leaving CMS.gov and the external site’s privacy and security policies will apply. Non-federal websites don’t necessarily operate under the same laws, regulations, and policies as federal websites. Other than third-party websites highlighted in this privacy notice, we aren’t responsible for the contents of external web pages and a link to a page doesn’t constitute an endorsement.
Social media & other sites that require registration
We use social media websites (listed below) to:
Increase government transparency
Improve information sharing
Promote public participation
Encourage partnership with CMS
Social media websites aren’t government websites or applications. They’re controlled or operated by the social media website. We don’t own, manage, or control social media websites. In addition, we don’t collect, maintain, or disseminate information posted by visitors to those social media websites. If you choose to provide information to a social media website through registration or other interaction with the website, the use of any information you provide is controlled by your relationship with the social media website. For example, any information that you provide to register on Facebook is voluntarily contributed and isn’t maintained by us. This information may be available to our social media page administrators in whole or part, based on a user's privacy settings on the social media website. However, we won’t use PII, if provided by you to a social media website or other website that requires registration, for targeted advertising or retargeting. Although you may voluntarily contribute to a social media website with the intent to share the information with others on a CMS social media page, to protect your privacy, don’t disclose PII about yourself or others.
We don’t keep separate records or accounting of any social media website users or their interaction with the CMS.gov pages on social media websites. We don’t store or share this information. User information is retained by social media websites in accordance with the website’s policies. See each social media website’s privacy policy to see how long user information is retained after an account has been deleted. To learn more about how each social media website uses and maintains information visit their privacy policy, as follows:

Freedom of Information Act
     	






 



The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), found in Title 5 of the United States Code, section 552, was enacted in 1966 and provides that, upon request from any person, a Federal agency must release any agency record unless that record falls within one of the nine statutory exemptions and three exclusions. The FOIA binds only Federal agencies, and covers only records in the possession and control of Federal agencies. The FOIA was amended recently by PL 104-231.
The Citizen's Guide on using the FOIA and Privacy Act of 1974 to Request Government Records explains how to use the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act of 1974. It reflects all changes to the laws made since 1996. This Guide is intended to serve as a general introduction to the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. It offers neither a comprehensive explanation of the details of these acts, nor an analysis of case law. The Guide will, however, enable those who are unfamiliar with the laws to understand the process and to make a request. In addition, the complete text of each law is included in an appendix.Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Requests
You can make the following requests through the Freedom of Information Act:
A list of physicians that do not submit their bills to Medicare in an electronic format.
A copy of records on yourself.
A copy of records on someone other than yourself.
A copy of records on all other CMS/Medicare/Medicaid program matters.
To access the Freedom of Information Act Request Form, see the Downloads area below.
For more about the Freedom of Information Act and its request process, access the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) section in the Related Links Inside CMS below.

No Fear Act
     	






 



Section 301 of the Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002 (the No Fear Act), requires each Federal agency to post summary statistical data pertaining to complaints of employment discrimination filed against it by employees, former employees and applicants for employment under 29 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 1614. The specific data to be posted is described in section 301(b) of the Act and 29 CFR 1614.704.
The posting of Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) data on agency public Web sites is intended to assist Congress, Federal agencies and the public to assess whether, and the extent to which, agencies are living up to their equal employment opportunity responsibilities.
Additional information about the No Fear Act can be found in the Downloads and Related Links areas below.

Coverage to Care (C2C) is an initiative, developed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, to help you understand your health coverage and connect to the primary care and the preventive services that are right for you, so you can live a long and healthy life.

Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Service Center
     	






 


 
What is FOIA?
Since 1967, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has provided the public the right to request access to records from any federal agency. It is often described as the law that keeps citizens in the know about their government. Federal agencies are required to disclose any records requested under the FOIA unless the release of records falls under one of nine exemptions which protect interests such as personal privacy, national security, and law enforcement. As Congress, the President, and the Supreme Court have all recognized, the FOIA is a vital part of our democracy.
What is the Presumption of Openness and Who Issues Guidance to Agencies on the FOIA?
The FOIA provides that when processing requests, agencies should withhold records only if they reasonably foresee that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption, or if disclosure is prohibited by law. Agencies should also consider whether partial disclosure of records is possible whenever they determine that full disclosure is not possible and they should take reasonable steps to segregate and release nonexempt records. The Office of Information Policy at the Department of Justice is responsible for issuing government-wide guidance on the FOIA as part of its responsibilities to encourage all agencies to fully comply with both the letter and the spirit of the FOIA.
How to File a CMS FOIA and/or FOIA/Privacy Act Request
For Medicare beneficiary claim records – Requestors, including third party requestors with proper Medicare HIPAA authorization, can now submit their FOIA/Privacy Act requests for an individual’s Medicare claims directly to CMS via our new Medicare Beneficiary Claims Portal.  This is the most efficient and timely way for CMS to gather records and respond to all our Medicare claim records requesters.
For any other CMS agency records (such as CMS cost reports, provider records, investigation records, policy records, or email records, etc.) – Members of the public can submit their FOIA requests directly to CMS via our electronic FOIA.gov Portal.
You may also submit requests via email, fax, or U.S. Mail.  Please note that it may take additional processing time to respond.
        E-mail your request to FOIA_Request@cms.hhs.gov                       
        Fax your request to 443-380-8871 
        Mail your request in an envelope, clearly marked “FOIA Request”, to
              Freedom of Information Act Office              Mail Stop C5-11-06              7500 Security Boulevard              Baltimore, Maryland 21244
Please choose only one method to submit your request to avoid duplicate requests (i.e., identical requests received via different means). CMS will act only on the initial request.
How Will CMS Process Your FOIA Request?
When CMS receives your FOIA request it is entered into CMS’ automated tracking system and assigned a control number. A FOIA analyst will review your request to understand the types(s) of records you wish to obtain and assign your request to the appropriate CMS program office(s) to search for responsive records. You will receive an acknowledgement letter with a control number and corresponding PIN number with instructions for checking the status of your request.
